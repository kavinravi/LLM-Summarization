INTRODUCTION\nThis environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared to disclose and analyze the environmental effects\nof the Proposed Action, which is for construction, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning of the\nDry Lake East Energy Center Solar Project (Project) proposed on approximately 1,683 acres of public\nlands in Clark County, Nevada. The Project is approximately 10 miles northeast of North Las Vegas\nadjacent to Interstate 15 (I-15) on public lands administered by the Las Vegas Field Office of the Bureau\nof Land Management\u2019s (BLM\u2019s) Southern Nevada District Office. The Project would consist of solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) arrays generating up to 200 megawatts (MW) of alternating current (AC) energy, an\nintegrated 200-MW battery energy storage system (BESS), a 400-MW standalone BESS, and a\n230-kilovolt (kV) generation tie-in (gen-tie) line approximately 3.5 miles long between an on-site\nsubstation and the existing Harry Allen Substation. In addition to the PV arrays, BESS, gen-tie line, and\non-site substation, the Project would include inverters, permanent perimeter fencing, access roads, and a\nsupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The Project location is shown in Figure 1-1\n(all figures in Appendix A).\nThe Project has been applied for through submittal of right-of-way (ROW) applications to the BLM for\nthe various Project components: a 200-MW AC solar PV facility, the 200-MW integrated BESS, the\non-site substation, and the gen-tie line (Boulevard Associates, LLC, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy\nResources, LLC [Applicant]); a 400-MW standalone BESS and associated infrastructure (Applicant);\nshort-term use of areas that fall outside of the Project boundary during construction (Applicant); and a\nshift in a portion of the alignment for the existing Harry Allen to Pecos #1 Transmission Line near the\nHarry Allen Substation (NV Energy). All ROW applications are analyzed in this EA.\nDuring development of the EA, a Regional Mitigation Strategy (Appendix B) was also prepared to\nevaluate mitigation strategies and a recipient site for mitigation funds for unavoidable impacts to\nresources identified in the EA. Section 8 of the Approved Resource Management Plan\nAmendments/Record of Decision (ROD) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States\n(Western Solar Plan ROD) (BLM 2012a) stated that the BLM would develop a regional mitigation\nstrategy for each solar energy zone (SEZ) (areas defined by the BLM where utility-scale production of\nsolar energy and associated transmission infrastructure will be prioritized). Development of the Regional\nMitigation Strategy is consistent with BLM Instruction Memorandum No. 2021-046, which reinstated the\nBLM\u2019s Manual Section (MS-1794) and Handbook (H-1794-1). The framework also follows guidance in\nthe BLM\u2019s Draft Procedural Guidance for Developing Solar Regional Mitigation Strategies (BLM\n2014a).\nThe Project, excepting the portion of the gen-tie line that extends across I-15 to the Harry Allen\nSubstation, is in the BLM\u2019s Dry Lake East Designated Leasing Area (DLA). A DLA is a parcel of land\nwith specific boundaries identified by the BLM land use planning process as being a preferred location\nfor solar energy development that may be offered competitively. DLAs have replaced SEZs in BLM\nregulations, and therefore the guidance in the Western Solar Plan ROD is applicable to DLAs. The Dry\nLake East DLA was established for the development of utility-scale solar PV energy generation and\ntransmission facilities. The environmental effects of establishing this DLA were analyzed by the BLM in\nthe Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment and Final Environmental Assessment for Dry Lake\nEast Designated Leasing Area (Dry Lake East DLA EA) (BLM 2019a). The Applicant was the successful\nbidder in a competitive bidding procedure to determine a preferred ROW applicant for the Dry Lake East\nDLA. This EA tiers to the Dry Lake East DLA EA in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations\n(CFR) 1501.11, and will assist the BLM in the Project\u2019s planning, ensuring compliance with the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), and making a determination as to whether any significant effects\ncould result from the analyzed actions. Following the requirements of NEPA (40 CFR 1501.5), this EA\ndescribes the potential impacts of a No Action Alternative and the Proposed Action. If the BLM\ndetermines that the Proposed Action is not expected to have significant effects, a finding of no significant\n1\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nimpact will be issued, and a Decision Record will be prepared. If significant effects are anticipated, the\nBLM will prepare an environmental impact statement or select the No Action Alternative.\n1.1 PURPOSE AND NEED\nIn accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), public lands are to\nbe managed for multiple uses, which includes accounting for the long-term needs of future generations for\nrenewable and nonrenewable resources. The BLM is authorized to grant ROWs on public lands for\nsystems of generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy (FLPMA Section 501(a)(4)).\nThe purpose of the BLM\u2019s action (processing the Project applications) is to determine whether the Project\nis consistent with relevant laws, regulations, and policies, and therefore should be authorized for\ndevelopment on public land. The need for the action is to respond to the requests for ROW authorizations\nto construct, operate, maintain, and decommission the proposed Project in accordance with the BLM\u2019s\nresponsibility under the FLPMA and 43 CFR 2800. The need for the BLM\u2019s action is also created by the\nBLM\u2019s obligation to contribute toward the achievement of the goals established in Section 3104 of the\nEnergy Act of 2020 and Executive Order (EO) 14057 through the development of renewable energy\nproduction on federal public land.\n1.2 APPLICANT\u2019S PROJECT OBJECTIVES\nThe objective of the Applicant is to construct, operate, and maintain an efficient, economic, reliable, safe,\nand environmentally sound solar-powered generating facility that would provide an up to 200-MW AC\nsolar PV facility, an integrated 200-MW BESS, and a 400-MW standalone BESS that produces and stores\nup to 200 MW of solar-generated electricity and provides 400 MW of additional storage for the electrical\ngrid. The Applicant is pursuing issuance of Title V FLPMA ROWs from the BLM.\nThe Nevada Renewable Portfolio Standard (Nevada Revised Statutes 704.7821) was revised and signed\non April 22, 2019, by Senate Bill 358 to state that for calendar years 2024\u20132026, no less than 34% of the\ntotal amount of electricity sold by the provider (NV Energy for the Las Vegas area) to its retail customers\nin Nevada must be from renewable energy resources. Additionally, a solar \u201ccarve out\u201d was included,\nwhich states that beginning in 2020, at least 22% of the energy should be from solar. NV Energy expects\nto acquire renewable energy from multiple generating facilities to meet, at a minimum, the mandated\nRenewable Portfolio Standard target of 20% of retail sales coming from renewable resources to 29% in\n2022\u20132023, 34% in 2024\u20132026, 42% in 2027\u20132029, 50% in 2030, and 100% (zero carbon) by 2050. The\nProject is being developed to supply renewable electric energy (as an alternative to new fossil fuel\ngeneration resources) to serve the electrical load requirements in Nevada by delivering renewable energy\ninto the Nevada energy grid.\n1.3 DECISION TO BE MADE\nThe BLM\u2019s action is to respond to the applications for use of BLM-administered lands for the Project.\nThe BLM will decide whether to deny the proposed ROWs, grant the ROWs, or grant the ROWs with\nmodifications. The BLM may include any terms, conditions, and stipulations it determines to be in the\npublic interest and may include modifying the proposed use or changing the route or location of the\nproposed facilities (43 CFR 2805.10(b)(1)). In the decision process, the BLM must consider how the\nBLM\u2019s resource management goals, objectives, opportunities, and/or conflicts relate to this non-federal\nuse of public lands.\n2\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n1.4 CONFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe Proposed Action is in conformance with the 1998 Record of Decision for the Approved Las Vegas\nResource Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement (Las Vegas RMP) (BLM 1998),\nas amended, because it is consistent with the following objectives and management direction:\n\u2022 RW-1: \u201cMeet public demand and reduce impacts to sensitive resources by providing an orderly\nsystem of development for transportation, including legal access to private inholdings,\ncommunications, flood control, major utility transmission lines, and related facilities.\u201d (BLM\n1998:19)1\n\u2022 RW-1-h: \u201cAll public land within the planning area, except as stated in RW-1-c through RW-1-g,\nare available at the discretion of the agency for rights-of-way under the authority of the Federal\nLand Policy Management Act.\u201d (BLM 1998:19)\nThe Las Vegas RMP was amended by the BLM\u2019s Western Solar Plan ROD (BLM 2012a). As explained\nin the Western Solar Plan ROD, its amendments to relevant resource management plans (RMPs)\n(including the 1998 Las Vegas RMP) \u201cinclude the identification of exclusion areas for utility-scale solar\nenergy ROWs, priority areas for utility-scale solar energy ROWs (i.e., solar energy zones [SEZs]), and\nareas potentially available for utility-scale solar energy development outside of exclusion areas and SEZs\n(i.e., variance areas). Land use plan amendments also establish required programmatic and SEZ-specific\ndesign features for solar energy development on public lands to ensure the most environmentally\nresponsible development and delivery of solar energy\u201d (BLM 2012a:3).\nThe Las Vegas RMP was further amended by the Decision Record for the Resource Management Plan\nAmendment for the Dry Lake East Designated Leasing Area (BLM 2019b). The Decision Record\napproved the proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment evaluated as the Proposed Action in the\nDry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a). The following decisions were approved in the Decision Record:\n1. The Dry Lake East area was designated as a DLA for future development of utility-scale solar PV\nenergy generation and transmission, ensuring that public lands are managed according to the\nprinciples of multiple use identified in FLPMA.\n2. The visual resource management (VRM) Class III was changed to VRM Class IV.\n1.5 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS AND ANALYSES\nThe Proposed Action would also be consistent with other officially approved federal, state, and local\nplans, policies, and programs and with applicable federal regulations, policies, and laws. The following\ndocuments as they relate to the Proposed Action have been reviewed and considered as the EA has been\ndeveloped:\n\u2022 Clark County, Nevada, Comprehensive Master Plan (Clark County Department of\nComprehensive Planning 2014): Supports multiple uses of public lands outside of special\nmanagement areas that do not negatively impact the environment.\n\u2022 Western Solar Plan ROD (BLM 2012a): Evaluates utility-scale solar energy development to\ndevelop and implement agency-specific programs or guidance that would establish environmental\npolicies and mitigation strategies for solar energy projects and amends relevant BLM land use\nplans with consideration of establishing a new BLM solar energy program.\n1 Note, in this EA, the value(s) after the colon represent the page number(s) where the information appears within the cited\ndocument.\n3\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n\u2022 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Solar Energy Development in Six\nSouthwestern States (Western Solar Plan PEIS) (BLM and U.S. Department of Energy [DOE]\n2012): Evaluates actions to further facilitate utility-scale solar energy development in Arizona,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. This is a more specific SEZ analysis so\nthat the BLM can tier future project authorizations to limit the required scope and effort of\nproject-specific NEPA analyses.\n\u2022 Regional Mitigation Strategy for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone (BLM 2014b): Presents a\nstrategy for compensating for the unavoidable impacts expected from development of the Dry\nLake SEZ.\n\u2022 Programmatic Agreement (BLM 2012b): Establishes the process the BLM will follow to fulfill its\nresponsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for site-specific, solar\napplication decisions implemented in accordance with decisions supported by the Western Solar\nPlan PEIS.\n\u2022 Vegetation Treatments Using Aminopyralid, Fluroxypyr, and Rimsulfuron on Bureau of Land\nManagement Lands in 17 Western States Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (BLM\n2016): Addresses human health and ecological risk for the proposed use of chemical herbicides\non public lands in 17 western states, including Nevada, and provides a cumulative impact analysis\naddressing the use of chemical herbicide in conjunction with other treatment methods.\n1.6 SCOPING, PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT, AND ISSUES\nScoping provides an opportunity for members of the public and agencies to learn about a proposed project\nand share their concerns. Input from the scoping process is used to determine the issues requiring analysis\nin the EA and any potential alternatives to the Proposed Action. The scoping process also helps identify\nissues that are not considered relevant and can be eliminated from detailed analysis in the EA. During\ninternal scoping, BLM Las Vegas Field Office resource specialists identified resource areas of concern\nduring Project initiation meetings. They also reviewed the Proposed Action and identified resources\nknown to be present in the area with potential for impact. The BLM conducted public scoping from\nFebruary 21 to March 22, 2023. More details about scoping can be found in Chapter 4 (Consultation and\nCoordination) of this EA.\nThe BLM considered the potential impacts to these resources to determine whether detailed analysis was\nrequired. Some of these resources are under consideration to ensure compliance with laws, statutes, or\nEOs that impose certain requirements on all federal actions. Other resources are relevant to the\nmanagement of public lands in general and the BLM Las Vegas Field Office in particular. Resources\nbrought forward for, or dismissed from, analysis are listed in Chapter 3, along with the reason for\ninclusion or dismissal.\nThe BLM consulted with Native American tribes on a government-to-government basis in accordance\nwith EO 13175 and other policies and tribal concerns have been given due consideration. Federal, state,\nand local agencies, along with other stakeholders that may be interested in or affected by the BLM\u2019s\ndecision on this Project, were invited to participate in the scoping process and, if eligible, can request or\nbe requested by the BLM to participate as a cooperating agency. The Chemehuevi Tribe accepted the\nBLM\u2019s invitation to be a cooperating agency.\n4\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nCHAPTER 2. PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES\n2.1 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants, the proposed Project would\nnot be constructed, and existing land uses in the Project area would continue. The BLM would continue to\nmanage the land consistent with the 1998 Las Vegas RMP (BLM 1998).\n2.2 PROPOSED ACTION\nThe Applicant is proposing to construct, operate, maintain, and decommission a project consisting of up\nto 200 MW of solar PV arrays, an integral 200 MW BESS to store energy from the solar PV arrays, and\nup to 400 MW of standalone BESS to support other renewable energy projects in the area on\napproximately 1,683 acres of public lands in Clark County, Nevada. The Project would also include an\non-site substation and ancillary facilities. The electrical power from the on-site substation would be\ntransmitted through an approximately 3.5-mile-long gen-tie line for delivery to the existing Harry Allen\nSubstation. Approximately 1.0 mile of the gen-tie line would be located within the solar/BESS site\nboundary and would be strung on new structures from the on-site substation to the western edge of the\nsolar/BESS site boundary. From the western edge of the solar/BESS site boundary, the gen-tie line would\nextend approximately 0.3 mile farther on new structures through the Dry Lake SEZ until it reaches the\nexisting Harry Allen to Pecos #1 230-kV transmission line. The remaining 2.2-mile segment of the new\ngen-tie line would connect to the existing Harry Allen Substation via the existing Harry Allen to Pecos\nline (through an upgrade from single to double circuit). The northwesternmost structure of the Harry\nAllen to Pecos #1 transmission line is already carrying two 230-kV lines. One of the existing 230-kV\nlines would be shifted to a new structure north of the Harry Allen to Pecos #1 transmission line. A\ndetailed Project layout is shown in Figures 2-2 through 2-7.\nThe Project area is defined as the solar/BESS site boundary in the DLA, the 100-foot-wide gen-tie line\nROW, roads outside of the solar/BESS site boundary or gen-tie line ROW, the short-term ROW, and the\nHarry Allen to Pecos #1 transmission line shift ROW into the Harry Allen Substation. The total acreage of\nthe Project area is approximately 1,683 acres (Table 2-1, all tables in Appendix C). The preliminary legal\ndescription for the Project is provided in Appendix D. Project overview maps are provided in Appendix A.\n2.2.1 Proposed Action Components\nThis section provides a summary of the proposed Project components and facilities. A detailed\nexplanation of each component and its corresponding construction requirements is provided in the Project\nplans of development (PODs): the Dry Lake East Energy Center On-site Generation and Storage\nPreliminary Plan of Development (Boulevard Associates, LLC 2023a) and Dry Lake East Energy Center\nStorage for Off-site Generation Preliminary Plan of Development (Boulevard Associates, LLC 2023b).\nTable 2-2 provides an overview of the approximate amount of disturbance for the Project. The Project is\nexpected to disturb approximately 1,174.9 acres of the 1,683.4-acre Project area (69.8% of the Project\narea). Of this total, approximately 880.2 acres (52.3% of the Project area) would be temporary\ndisturbance and approximately 294.7 acres (17.5% of the Project area) would be permanent disturbance.\n2.2.1.1 Photovoltaic Modules/Arrays\nPV modules (or panels) would be grouped together in solar arrays, or collections of solar panels wired\ntogether in a circuit. The direct current (DC) electricity generated by the solar panels would be converted\nto AC by inverters. Based on the current conceptual design, each inverter block is intended to produce a\n5\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nnet power output of approximately 4 MW (as AC). The estimated number of PV modules planned for\ninstallation is approximately 500,000. The exact number would be determined once modules are\nprocured. Because solar energy technologies continue to evolve at a rapid rate, the exact arrangement and\nnature of the PV systems would be determined during the final design.\nFor maximum efficiency and to provide clearance above vegetation left under modules, modules would\nbe installed 12 inches above the tallest vegetation when at their lowest point, which would result in a\nmaximum height of 10 feet above ground level if a single portrait module is used or 14 feet above ground\nlevel if a dual portrait module is used. However, engineering constraints may require a slight increase in\nheight for some modules, so once installed, modules may extend approximately 11 to 16 feet above\nground level. Additionally, trimming of existing vegetation may occur to maintain a height of no shorter\nthan 18 inches aboveground, assuming this height meets the 12-inch minimum clearance requirements for\nthe PV systems.\n2.2.1.2 Solar Trackers and/or Fixed Support Structures\nA solar tracking mechanism is used to maximize the solar energy conversion efficiency by keeping the\nmodules perpendicular to the sun\u2019s rays throughout the day. This completed assembly of PV modules\nmounted on a framework structure is called a \u201ctracker\u201d because it tracks the sun from east to west. At this\ntime, there are two types of tracker systems that may be selected for the Project: a ganged tracker system\nor a standalone tracker system. A ganged tracker system uses one actuator to control multiple rows of PV\nmodules through a series of mechanical linkages and/or gearboxes. A standalone tracker system uses a\nsingle actuator for each row of PV modules. The exact tracker manufacturer and model would be\ndetermined in the final design. All trackers are intended to function the same in terms of following the\nposition of the sun.\nModule layout and spacing is optimized to balance energy production vs. peak capacity and would\ndepend on the sun\u2019s angle and shading caused by the horizon surrounding the Project. The spacing\nbetween the rows of trackers is dependent on site-specific features and tracker selection. Spacing would\nbe identified in the final design, but the current anticipated configuration includes 16.5-foot spacing\nbetween rows (post to post), which allows 12 feet of clearance for maintenance vehicles and panel access.\n2.2.1.3 Electrical Collection System\nPV modules generate a low-voltage DC electrical output that is not suitable for direct connection to the\nAC utility grid. The electrical collection system would be designed to convert the output power from the\nPV modules from DC to AC, transform the power from low voltage to transmission-level voltage for\nconnection to the grid, and supply auxiliary power to the tracker systems. The DC output from the PV\narrays would be transmitted to inverters through a combination of aboveground and underground DC\nelectrical cables. Aboveground 1,500-volt string wiring would run along the backside of the panels, and\naboveground 1,500-volt DC collection wiring would run along the sides of array roads before extending\nunderground to the inverters. Underground 34.5-kV collection wiring would then run between the\ninverters and to the substation.\nThe number of modules connected to each inverter is dependent on the specific model of modules,\ninverters, and their capacities, which would be selected in the final design. To allow for greater electrical\nproduction in off-peak hours and an overall increase in power production, the DC quantity would exceed\nthe AC plant rating by a range of 25% to 40%. The resulting AC current from each individual inverter\npackage would then be routed through cable or solid busbars to the adjacent medium-voltage step-up\ntransformer. The output voltage from each inverter would be increased to the desired substation feed\nvoltage (34.5 kV) by these step-up transformers. From the inverters, the collected 34.5 kV of AC power\nwould be delivered to the on-site substation.\n6\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nSite geotechnical conditions permitting, the inverters would sit on pads of earthen material that would be\nbuilt up approximately 12 inches using a combination of on-site and clean off-site soils, with a 3-inch\nlayer of aggregate placed on top. The inverter skids would then be placed on a foundation support system,\nsuch as driven piers (piles) or a concrete slab, on each pad. All inverters would be painted the color RAL\n7035 grey or an equivalent color depending on availability.\n2.2.1.4 Battery Energy Storage System\nThe Project would use an integral 200-MW BESS connected with an AC-coupled system. The\nAC-coupled system would be connected to a bidirectional inverter to convert DC energy to AC energy,\nallowing for energy to flow in or out of the batteries to provide charge and discharge. This AC energy\nwould be coupled to the PV array at the 34.5-kV busbars. Power switches and relays would protect the\nsystem. These systems would consist of several housing units that look similar to shipping containers.\nThe 400-MW standalone BESS would be connected to NV Energy\u2019s grid through the substation. The\ncomponents of the standalone BESS would be similar in nature to the 200-MW BESS but would function\nslightly differently because the batteries would not be charged by the PV array. Battery containers would\nstore the energy until it is ready to be discharged to the grid, and inverters would convert the DC from the\nbatteries to AC that would then be sent to the substation via medium voltage collection cable and injected\nonto the grid. The medium voltage collection cable would be installed along proposed access roads. After\nthe batteries discharge, they would recharge in the reverse order at a later time depending on the load on\nNV Energy\u2019s grid. Battery containers and inverters would be installed on a foundation system such as\nconcrete pads or driven piles.\n2.2.1.5 On-Site Substation and Control House\nThe output power from the inverter stations would be fed to an AC collection system that delivers\nelectricity to the on-site substation. Electricity would then be transmitted to the gen-tie line that extends to\nthe existing Harry Allen Substation. An aboveground distribution line to the on-site substation may be\nneeded to provide construction power and backup power to the solar and energy storage facilities for\nlighting and communications purposes. Alternatively, generators may be used to provide construction and\nbackup power. The substation would include an unoccupied control house that would be designed and\nconstructed consistent with applicable state and local building codes.\n2.2.1.6 Interconnection via Gen-Tie Line to Harry Allen Substation\nThe electrical power from the on-site substation would be transmitted through an approximately\n3.5-mile-long gen-tie line for delivery to the existing Harry Allen Substation. Approximately 1.0 mile of\nthe gen-tie line would be located within the solar/BESS site boundary and would be strung on new poles\nfrom the on-site substation to the western edge of the solar/BESS site boundary. From the western edge of\nthe solar/BESS site boundary, the gen-tie line would extend approximately 0.3 mile farther on new\nstructures until it reaches the existing Harry Allen to Pecos #1 230-kV transmission line. The remaining\n2.2-mile segment of the new gen-tie line would connect to the existing Harry Allen Substation via the\nexisting Harry Allen to Pecos line (through an upgrade from single to double circuit). In addition, since\nthe northwesternmost structure of the Harry Allen to Pecos #1 transmission line is already carrying two\n230-kV lines, one of those existing 230-kV lines would be shifted to a new structure north of the Harry\nAllen to Pecos #1 transmission line. New and existing gen-tie line poles would range from approximately\n100 to 130 feet in height, depending on location and final design, and would be made of steel.\nThe gen-tie line would be constructed for the nominal operating voltage of the substation, which is\n230 kV. Monopole or guyed-V transmission structures would be used where required. Final hardware\ndesign would be determined during final engineering of the gen-tie line.\n7\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n2.2.1.7 Interstate 15 Crossing\nThe gen-tie line would cross the ROW of I-15 immediately west of the solar/BESS site. The Applicant\nwould obtain an encroachment permit from the Nevada Department of Transportation, which would\nreview proposed activities necessary for construction, evaluate environmental resources within the ROW,\nand evaluate methods of traffic control to reduce hazards to highway traffic. In addition, construction of\nthe gen-tie line crossing would comply with Nevada Department of Transportation guidance.\n2.2.1.8 Access Roads\nAccess roads are shown on Figures 2-1 through 2-7. An Access Management Plan would be developed as\na framework for Project access.\n2.2.1.8.1 EXISTING ACCESS ROADS\nThe solar/BESS site would be accessed from Exit 64 on I-15, following an existing paved road that runs\nnorthward on the south/east side of I-15. The portion of the gen-tie line on the west side of I-15 would be\naccessed from the same exit, following the existing paved Las Vegas Boulevard that runs northward on\nthe north/west side of I-15. Another paved road leading toward the Harry Allen Substation would also be\nused. In total, approximately 2.4 miles of existing paved roads would be used for Project access.\nSeveral primary and secondary access roads would also be used for the Project. From the end of the\nexisting paved road on the south/east side of I-15, the primary access road for the Project would follow\nthe existing unpaved access road of the Harry Allen to Mead 500-kV transmission line eastward for\napproximately 0.7 mile. This existing road is approximately 24 feet wide and constructed of compacted\nsoil and gravel. The Project also includes approximately 0.4 mile of existing secondary access roads.\nThese existing secondary roads are constructed of compacted soil and gravel and are approximately 16\nfeet in width. If necessary, improvements may be made to primary and secondary access roads using\ncompacted gravel aggregate.\nOn the west side of I-15, the Project includes approximately 3.4 miles of existing access roads that would\nbe used to access the existing portion of the gen-tie line. These roads are approximately 14 feet wide and\nwould be widened to 20 feet. The roads are currently constructed of compacted soil and gravel. Road\nwidening efforts would use compacted soil and gravel and, if necessary, improvements may be made to\nthese roads using compacted gravel aggregate.\n2.2.1.8.2 NEW ACCESS ROADS\nFrom the east end of the existing primary access road, a new primary access road would head south and\nextend throughout the proposed on-site substation and integral 200-MW BESS. Another new primary\naccess road would extend from the existing primary access road north to the proposed laydown area; this\napproximately 0.1-mile-long road would be temporary. In total, there would be approximately 2.1 miles\nof new primary access roads for the Project. These roads would be 24 feet wide with 2-foot-wide\nshoulders on each side and constructed of compacted gravel aggregate.\nThe Project includes approximately 3.9 miles of new secondary access roads. These roads are intended to\nconcentrate travel within the solar array during construction and for operations and maintenance\nactivities. They would also be necessary to construct and maintain the portion of the gen-tie line within\nthe Project area. These new roads would be approximately 12 feet wide with 4-foot-wide shoulders on\neach side and constructed of compacted gravel aggregate.\nIn accordance with Clark County requirements referencing the International Fire Code, perimeter roads\nmay also be required around the solar facilities. These roads would be approved fire apparatus access\n8\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nroads; however, fire apparatus access roads can be exempted or modified for solar PV power generation\nfacilities when allowed by the fire code official (Clark County Code 5(503.1)). If required, there would be\napproximately 14.8 miles of these roads. These roads would be 20 feet wide with 2-foot-wide shoulders\non each side and constructed of compacted gravel aggregate.\nOn the west side of I-15, the Project includes approximately 0.1 mile of new 20-foot-wide access road\nthat would be used to access a portion of the proposed gen-tie line. This road would be constructed of\ncompacted gravel aggregate.\n2.2.1.9 Construction Access Paths\nConstruction access paths would be temporary 12-foot-wide overland travel paths and would be\ninterspersed between the secondary access roads to complete construction activities that require being\nimmediately adjacent to the solar panels and equipment. To the degree practicable, construction access\npaths would be limited to every other row of panels to minimize overland travel disturbance across the\nsolar array areas.\n2.2.1.10 Site Security and Fencing\nThe solar, BESS, and on-site substation would be permanently fenced with chain-link security fencing to\nrestrict public access during construction and operations. The security fence would be approximately 7\nfeet tall, including approximately 1 foot of barbed wire (three strands) mounted on 45\u00b0 extension arms.\nThe fence would have a dulled galvanized finish to reduce the potential for glare and contrast with the\nsurrounding landscape. The fence posts would be set in concrete or driven into the ground.\nPermanent Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) (referred to as desert tortoise or tortoise in this\nEA) fencing would be installed along the bottom of the security fence in each subarea. For other areas\nwhere security fencing and permanent tortoise fencing would not be needed, temporary tortoise exclusion\nfencing would be installed to create a fully enclosed area for tortoise clearance efforts. The combination\nof permanent and temporary fencing would result in a tortoise clearance area of approximately 1,348\nacres from which tortoises would be translocated.\nControlled access gates would be located at all entrances to the facility. The solar/BESS site would be\nclosed to public access by a permanent locking gate at or within the boundary of the Project area. Site\ngates would be swing- or rolling-type access gates. A modified gate design would be installed at all gate\nlocations along the perimeter fencing to prevent desert tortoise from entering the Project area. This could\ninclude a brush or other stiff lip along the bottom of the fence to prevent tortoises from passing under the\ngate, or other designs with BLM and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) approval. Desert tortoise\nclearance and translocation would take place after desert tortoise fencing is installed. After desert tortoise\nclearance has taken place and construction occurs, temporary desert tortoise fencing would be removed.\n2.2.1.11 Signage\nA small sign would be installed at the site\u2019s main entry to the Project. The sign would be no larger than\n8 \u00d7 4 feet and would read \u201cDry Lake East Energy Center.\u201d In addition, required safety signs would be\ninstalled on the fence near the entrance, identifying high voltage within the facility and providing\ninformation for emergency services.\n2.2.1.12 Plant Auxiliary Systems\nPlant auxiliary systems would be designed to control, protect, and support the Project and its operations.\nThese systems include the lighting system and the fire protection system, as described below.\n9\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nPermanent outdoor night lighting would be provided at the substation, although some portable lighting\nmay be required for maintenance activities that must be performed at night. Lighting would be kept to the\nminimum required for safety and security. Sensors, switches, and timers would be used to keep lighting\nturned off when not required, and all lights would be hooded and directed downward to minimize\nbackscatter and off-site light. Lighting would be attached to structural supports where possible or affixed\nto ground-mounted poles that are approximately 15 to 20 feet high.\nFire protection would be necessary for the facility during Project construction and operations. During\nconstruction activities, a water truck or other portable trailer-mounted water tank would be kept on-site\nand available to workers for use in extinguishing small human-made fires. All vehicles working on-site\nwould also carry a portable fire extinguisher. The fire protection systems for operations would consist of\nportable water tanks (water buffalos) and portable fire extinguishers. Additional emergency response\nwould be provided externally by local municipalities, if required. The Applicant would develop a Fire\nManagement Plan in consultation with the BLM.\n2.2.1.13 Temporary Construction Workspace, Yards, Staging Areas\nA temporary staging area for construction laydown and parking would be established within the Project\narea. In addition, temporary staging areas would be used within the solar array areas. The exact number\nand location of temporary staging areas in the solar arrays would be determined by the contractor and\nprovided to the BLM prior to construction. Overall, the Applicant assumes that 12 to 17 temporary\nstaging areas would be needed. Temporary staging areas would include fenced parking, covered trash\ndisposal facilities, construction trailers, a laydown area, and sufficient portable toilets and potable water\nfor use by the construction staff. Mobile trailers, modular offices, or an equivalent would be used as\nconstruction offices for Project and subcontractor personnel. During construction, temporary utilities\nwould be provided for the construction offices, laydown area, and Project area. Prior to the availability of\npermanent distribution power, temporary construction power would be provided by NV Energy via a new\ndistribution line or would come from temporary diesel generators located in the staging area. Temporary\nlighting would be provided and strategically located to ensure safety and security of the construction area.\nConstruction materials such as concrete, pipe, wire and cable, reinforcing steel, small tools, and\nconsumables would be delivered to the site by truck as needed. Access to the Project construction site\nwould be controlled for personnel and vehicles. During the site grading process (where grading is\nneeded), equipment would be stored overnight and during weekends and holidays. Fencing and/or gates\nmay be installed at the equipment storage areas. This temporary area may be moved periodically to allow\nfor completion of grading across the site. All temporary disturbance areas would be restored in\naccordance with the Project\u2019s Restoration and Decommissioning Plan.\n2.2.2 Project Construction\nThe following subsections describe the construction process and schedule for the Project. The Project\nwould be designed in accordance with the latest edition of the International Building Code, state and local\nrequirements, and applicable wind and seismic criteria for the Project location. Additional information is\nprovided in the PODs (Boulevard Associates, LLC 2023a, 2023b).\n2.2.2.1 Construction Process\nProject construction would consist of several phases, including mobilization and staging; site preparation;\nmechanical, electrical, and substation installation; solar array and BESS construction (posts, racking,\nmodules, combiner boxes, and inverters); overhead gen-tie line construction; commissioning (electrical\ntesting and energization); demobilization of equipment and staging areas; and site reclamation of\ntemporary disturbance areas.\n10\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n2.2.2.2 Construction Equipment and Schedule\nTypical equipment that would be used for the Project is shown in Table 2-3. The proposed construction\nschedule is shown in Table 2-4. Construction would generally occur between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday\nthrough Friday. Additional hours may be necessary to make up schedule deficiencies or to complete\ncritical construction activities. For instance, during placement of concrete or during hot weather, it may be\nnecessary to start work earlier to avoid some activities during high ambient temperatures. During the\nstart-up phase, some activities (such as equipment and system testing) may continue 24 hours per day, 7\ndays per week. A worker environmental awareness program would be provided to all Project personnel\ndetailing the key features of the Project area\u2019s landscape and environment, factors contributing to fire\nrisk, and considerations for potential cultural or paleontological resources found on-site.\n2.2.2.3 Construction Personnel and Transportation\nOn-site residential areas for construction workers would not be provided. Construction workers would\nmost likely commute from the Las Vegas area. During peak construction periods, up to 300 workers\nwould be on-site. Approximately 100 to 200 workers are anticipated for non-peak construction periods\n(i.e., periods of the construction process when fewer workers are needed on-site).\nAt the peak of construction, approximately 300 vehicles carrying construction workers would be driving\nto and from the Project area each day during the typical a.m. and p.m. peak hours. In addition, although\nmost workers are expected to arrive and depart during these peak hours, specialty workers are expected to\narrive on-site during non-peak hours. Approximately 25 trucks per day are expected to deliver various\nmaterials and construction equipment during peak periods, with five trucks per day during non-peak\nperiods. A Traffic Management Plan would be prepared prior to construction for review by the BLM.\n2.2.2.4 Site Preparation\nThe Applicant would use a variety of site methods to prepare the site using the least impactful option that\nmeets development, engineering, construction, safety, and environmental requirements. Methods may\ninclude clear and cut/drive and crush, clear and cut with soil removal, and overland travel.\nPrior to site preparation activities, temporary tortoise fencing would be installed inside the Project\nboundary. An approximately 20-foot buffer between the fencing and the site boundary perimeter would\nbe established as a temporary work area for fence construction access, if needed. All tortoise exclusion\nfencing would be in accordance with USFWS-recommended specifications. Once tortoise fencing has\nbeen installed, tortoise clearance surveys would be completed to remove tortoises from within the fenced\narea. Construction activities would commence after removal of tortoises from within the fenced area.\nAuthorized grading and leveling would be done only in the areas where the elevation needs to be changed\nto accommodate the tracker/racking system tolerances, as well as roadways, access ways, and areas where\nconcrete foundations are used for inverter equipment, BESS, substations, and other structures. Grading\nwould consist of the excavation and compaction of earth to meet the design requirements. Grading within\nthe solar field would match existing contours to the extent feasible. Some existing contours would need to\nbe smoothed out for access purposes, but the macro-level topography and stormwater drainage would\nremain similar to pre-graded conditions. To the extent practicable, grading of an area would take place\nshortly before trenching to minimize the area of open, uncovered ground present at any time during\nconstruction. The portions of the Project area that would be graded are expected to result in a balanced\ncut-and-fill quantity of earthwork to maintain the existing conditions to the extent practicable for the\nprotection of the equipment and facilities. Fill would be compacted as necessary, and appropriate dust\nabatement measures would be implemented in accordance with the Project\u2019s Dust Abatement Plan. These\nmeasures may include restriction of vehicle speeds, watering of active areas, watering of stockpiles,\nwatering on roadways, track-out control at site exits, and other measures.\n11\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nIf excavation produces mineral materials within the Project area, the mineral materials would either be\nused within the ROW or stockpiled on-site for disposal by the BLM. If mineral materials are to be\nstockpiled on-site for future disposal, a specific BLM use authorization in the form of a contract would be\nrequired before the stockpiled mineral materials can removed from the ROW.\n2.2.2.5 Solar Array Assembly and Construction\nConstruction of the tracker/mounting assemblies may be conducted in a single area, and then the\nassemblies would be transported to the proper location and placed on the pre-installed supports.\nAlternatively, the array assembly may occur at the installation point. Final assembly typically involves\ntractors and forklifts to place the tracker/mounts onto the support structures. During this work there would\nbe multiple crews working the site with vehicles, including special vehicles for transporting the arrays.\nThe tracker/mount installations would be constructed using either driven steel posts, screw piles, or\npossibly concrete foundations if required. As the solar arrays are installed, other Project facilities would\nbe constructed concurrently. Within the solar fields, the electrical and instrumentation/control wiring\nwould be installed as discussed in the POD (Boulevard Associates, LLC 2023a). The wiring would be run\nto the location of the solar field controls and the circuits would be checked.\n2.2.2.6 Battery Energy Storage System Installation\nTo accommodate the BESS, the ground would be graded and foundations would be installed for battery\ncontainers and inverters. The battery containers would be placed and connected to the grounding grid. An\nunderground collection cable would be installed to connect the batteries and inverters to the medium\nvoltage busbar inside the substation. Site geotechnical conditions permitting, the foundations for the\nBESS would either consist of driven piles or would consist of an approximately 3-foot-deep gravel\nfoundation or approximately 1-foot-thick rebar reinforced concrete slab over approximately 3-foot-deep\ngravel or engineered fill.\n2.2.2.7 Gen-Tie Line Construction\nThe 230-kV gen-tie line would be constructed from the on-site substation to the Harry Allen Substation.\nGen-tie line construction would include installation of insulators, travelers, and hardware that would be\nattached to each gen-tie structure. New structures would be embedded directly into the ground and/or\nattached to poured concrete foundation along the gen-tie line route using a truck-mounted mobile crane.\nFollowing installation of the new gen-tie line structures, the conductor would be delivered to sites for\npulling and tensioning along the length of the gen-tie line. Equipment such as reel-stringing trailers,\ntensioning machines, pullers, and trucks would be used to install each conductor and shield wire. The\nconventional method for conductor installation includes lifting the wire between a puller at one end and a\ntensioner at the other end to tighten the line. If overland travel is required for this process, an all-terrain\nvehicle or similar type of vehicle would be used along the gen-tie line route. Temporary guard structures\nwould be installed to safely span I-15 and other active travel route crossings to ensure that the conductors\ndo not drop into the roads.\nAppropriate dust abatement measures would be identified in a Dust Abatement Plan. These measures may\ninclude restriction of vehicle speeds, watering of active areas, watering of stockpiles, watering on\nroadways, track-out control at site exits, and other measures.\n2.2.2.8 Gravel, Aggregate, and Concrete Needs and Sources\nConcrete would be required for construction of the substation foundations, equipment pads, and other\nfacilities. The site would have a contained concrete washout. Concrete, or any additional aggregate,\n12\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nwould be supplied from commercially available sources produced in nearby communities, most likely Las\nVegas. Temporary batch-plant activities are not expected to occur on-site.\n2.2.2.9 Water\nInitial construction water usage would be in support of site preparation and grading activities. During\nearthwork for the grading of access roads, foundations, equipment pads, and Project components, the\nmain use of water would be for compaction and dust control. Smaller quantities would be needed for\npreparation of the concrete required for foundations and other minor uses. After the earthwork activities,\nwater usage would be in support of dust suppression and normal construction water requirements.\nConstruction water would be obtained from a commercially available source and trucked to the site.\nWater would be stored in aboveground tanks with an estimated total storage capacity of up to 250,000\ngallons (0.77 acre-foot). The Applicant would determine the number and storage capacity of the\nindividual water tanks depending on daily water use. The tanks may be filled daily or as needed during\nconstruction. The estimated water requirements for construction and operations are provided in Table 2-5.\n2.2.2.10 Site Stabilization, Protection, and Reclamation Practices\nConstruction sites, material storage yards, and access roads would be kept in an orderly condition\nthroughout the construction period. Approved enclosed refuse containers would be used throughout the\nProject area. Disturbances to vegetation and soils would be carefully planned and minimized during\nconstruction. The postconstruction ROW would be restored in accordance with the approved Restoration\nand Decommissioning Plan.\n2.2.3 Related Facilities and Systems\n2.2.3.1 Transmission System Interconnect\nNearly all the power produced by the Project would be delivered to the grid. Most power needed at the\nsite for plant auxiliaries, such as control systems and general facility loads, including lighting and heating,\nventilation, and air conditioning, would be provided from external sources and not from on-site\ngeneration. However, when the plant generates power, a portion of the power would supply the control\nhouse through the station service transformer. The net power produced by the facility would be delivered\nfrom the Project substation to the existing Harry Allen Substation through an approximately\n3.5-mile-long 230-kV gen-tie line. The gen-tie line interconnection would require upgrading 2.2 miles of\nthe existing Harry Allen to Pecos #1 230-kV transmission line from a single- to a double-circuit line. In\naddition, because the northwesternmost structure of the Harry Allen to Pecos #1 transmission line is\nalready carrying two 230-kV lines, one of those existing 230-kV lines would be shifted to a new structure\nnorth of the Harry Allen to Pecos #1 transmission line.\nThe Project would require the construction of a new, on-site substation (no larger than 310 \u00d7 540 feet in\nsize) in the Project area. This substation could be larger, depending on the interconnection agreement,\nsince a loop-in to an existing line would require a larger footprint. The substation would consist of a\nseries of 35-kV breakers for collection of power from the solar field, a common bus, and a step-up\ntransformer. The substation would include parallel sets of internal power distribution systems\n(i.e., 34.5-kV buses and circuit breakers, disconnect switches, and multiple step-up transformers) to\nincrease the voltage to the 230-kV substation and transmission line voltage. The substation would use\ntubular aluminum alloy bus. Tubes, cables, and support structures would meet all electrical and\nmechanical design requirements. Instrument transformers (current and capacitive voltage transformers)\nwould be included for protection. Shield wires and lightning arrestors would be included to protect\n13\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nswitching station equipment and personnel against lightning strikes. Final substation equipment would be\ndetermined during final engineering of the proposed interconnection.\nThe proposed gen-tie line structures would consist of monopole structures reinforced as necessary to\nwithstand design loads. The structures would be approximately 100 to 130 feet high and directly\nembedded into the ground or installed on poured concrete foundations approximately 4 feet in diameter\nand up to 20 feet deep, depending on soil conditions. Once the structures are affixed into position, the\nexcavation would be backfilled using native soils, gravel, or concrete, as appropriate. The transmission\nlines would be insulated from the structures using insulators engineered for safe and reliable operation.\nShield wires would be included along the length of the lines to protect against lightning strikes. These\nsame structures would carry a single, insulated fiber-optic line to provide one part of the needed\nredundant communications system.\n2.2.3.2 Other Related Systems\nThe Project requires a SCADA system to keep track of the plant, control production, respond to grid\ndemands, and be able to take the plant off-line quickly if required for operations or safety reasons. A\nSCADA system collects data from various sensors throughout the plant and sends the data to a central\ncomputer, which then manages and controls the data. This system also communicates with the rest of the\ngrid. To comply with the grid interconnection requirements, the Project must provide redundant\ncommunications to the plant. The Applicant has assumed that two geographically diverse communication\npaths would be required for this Project. One of these communication paths would be a physical\ncommunication line connection, which would be installed overhead on the proposed gen-tie line. The\nsecond communication path would be accomplished via a proposed microwave tower that would be in the\nProject area. This system would be used entirely by the Project and have no third-party uses.\n2.2.4 Operations and Maintenance\nThe Project would be staffed by up to two operations personnel during the site\u2019s daytime working hours.\nOperations personnel would work a single daytime shift, Monday through Friday. During time periods\nwhen the facility is not fully staffed, the facility would be monitored. Under emergency conditions,\nfacility staff would be notified and would return to the facility, as required. Specialty personnel may also\nbe located on-site during non-working hours to perform specific maintenance functions as required.\nOperations staff would use up to five conex boxes for storage and indoor workspace. These unplumbed\nstructures are typically modified shipping containers that are approximately 8 feet wide and 40 feet long.\nThe containers would be located within the BESS and/or on-site substation disturbance areas and would\nnot have any additional disturbance associated with their installation.\nOperations and maintenance vehicles would include \u00be-ton pickup trucks and small utility vehicles to\nperform on-site welding, lubricating, and other maintenance activities. In addition, flatbed trucks, dump\ntrucks, and front-end loaders may be present on-site at various times. Heavy-haul transport equipment\nwould be brought to the site as needed for any major maintenance or equipment repair or replacement.\nThe Applicant intends to use designated internal access roads for regular operations. Infrequent access\nmay be needed outside designated access roads within the panel arrays to address unanticipated\nmaintenance events or emergencies. Any such access off the designated internal access roads would be\nshort term, with the intention to minimize ground and vegetation disturbance.\nThe facility would be maintained by staff personnel for normal preventative maintenance. This would\ninclude up to daily inspection of field components, condition assessment of critical equipment, and\nroutine lubrication of equipment. Structures would be repainted on a regular basis to maintain their\nappearance and provide protection from the elements.\n14\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nVegetation within the developed areas of the site would be maintained by mowing or trimming native\nspecies and by applying herbicide to nonnative and noxious weed species. Native vegetation would be\nmowed or trimmed, as necessary, to maintain a height of no shorter than 18 inches aboveground,\nassuming this height meets the 12-inch minimum clearance requirements for the PV systems. Equipment\nwould include a commercial-sized raised deck mower, or similar equipment. A bush hog or similar\nequipment typically is not needed but could be used in limited areas if vegetation is universally tall.\nHerbicide application would be applied following a Pesticide Management Plan and would only be\napplied to nonnative vegetation or noxious weed species.\nRoad maintenance would be performed as needed. Potholes or damage to the road would be repaired as\nsoon as practicable. Grading and drainage would be maintained for gravel and earthen roads. Water\nwould be applied, as required, to limit fugitive dust, as detailed in a Dust Abatement Plan. Security and\ndesert tortoise exclusion fencing would be maintained as needed. Damaged fencing would be repaired as\nsoon as practicable.\nProject staff would be located off-site and would be deployed as needed for checks and maintenance. The\nsubstation would be controlled remotely, and routine inspections by personnel would occur on a weekly\nbasis or as needed under emergency conditions. In addition, all substation structures would be inspected\nannually from the ground for corrosion, misalignment, and foundation condition. Ground inspection\nwould include the inspection of hardware, insulator keys, and conductors. This inspection would also\ncheck conductors and fixtures for corrosion, breaks, broken insulators, and bad splices.\nBattery systems have an initial right-size capacity (this includes auxiliary loads and losses) to deliver\nnameplate energy beginning the first day of operations. To maintain the same level of nameplate energy\nthrough the duration of the agreement, it is necessary to add new batteries to compensate for degradation\nof the initial batteries. The BESS would be constructed to allow for the addition of new batteries, as\nnecessary. Periodic replacement of the batteries is expected as often as every 5 years based on usage and\nquarterly inspections, though it is not uncommon for the batteries to last longer than 10 years. Inspections\nof the batteries would be performed as part of a preventive maintenance program. Spent batteries would\nbe recycled or disposed of off-site in accordance with 40 CFR 273.2 and 40 CFR 266.\nElectric lines, support systems, and instrumentation and controls would be inspected regularly to ensure\ntheir safe, efficient, and economical operation. The water storage tanks installed as part of the\nconstruction phase would remain for operations or would be replaced with new tanks of similar size if\nnecessary. The water tank would require frequent inspection and may need occasional repairs. This\nmaintenance would include routine painting of the storage tanks to protect them from corrosion.\n2.2.5 Waste and Hazardous Materials Management\nProject wastes would include nonhazardous solid waste, hazardous solid waste, and hazardous liquid\nwaste. A variety of safety-related plans and programs would be developed and implemented during\nconstruction and operations to ensure safe handling, storage, and use of hazardous materials. Facility\npersonnel would be supplied with appropriate personal protective equipment and would be properly\ntrained in the use of personal protective equipment and the handling, use, and cleanup of hazardous\nmaterials used at the facility, as well as procedures to be followed in the event of a leak or spill. Adequate\nsupplies of appropriate cleanup materials would be stored on-site.\n2.2.5.1 Solid and Nonhazardous Waste\nConstruction, operations, and maintenance of the Project would generate nonhazardous solid wastes\ntypical of power generation or other industrial facilities. Wastes would include oily rags, worn or broken\nmetal and machine parts, defective or broken electrical materials, other scrap metal and plastic, insulation\n15\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nmaterial, empty containers, paper, glass, and other miscellaneous solid wastes including the typical refuse\ngenerated by workers. These materials would be disposed by means of contracted refuse collection and\nrecycling services. Waste collection and disposal would be in accordance with applicable regulatory\nrequirements to minimize health and safety effects.\n2.2.5.2 Hazardous Chemicals\nA variety of hazardous materials would be used and stored during Project construction. During Project\noperations, hazardous materials would be used but would not be stored on-site. A Hazardous Materials\nand Waste Management Plan and Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan would be\ndeveloped and implemented in accordance with all federal and state requirements. Hazardous materials\nthat would be used during construction include gasoline, diesel fuel, oil, lubricants, and small quantities\nof solvents and paints. During construction, all hazardous materials would be stored on-site in storage\ntanks or vessels/containers that are specifically designed for the characteristics of the materials to be\nstored. The storage facilities would include secondary containment in case of tank/vessel failure.\n2.2.5.3 Hazardous Solid and Liquid Waste\nSmall quantities of hazardous wastes would be generated during Project construction and operations.\nHazardous wastes generated during the construction phase would include substances such as paint and\nprimer, thinners, and solvents.\n2.2.5.4 Recycling\nRecyclable materials may include paper, glass, plastic, aluminum cans, corrugated cardboard, wood, and\nmetals. Materials identified for recycling would be stored separately from solid and hazardous wastes in\nlabeled recycling containers. Depending on the availability of local recycling facilities, recycling services\nwould be contracted for on-site pickup, or recyclable materials would be transported by the Applicant and\nits contractor(s) to the nearest recycling facility.\nSome solar panels and batteries would occasionally require replacement during the operations and\nmaintenance phase of the Project and during decommissioning. Waste from end-of-life solar panels and\nbatteries may have potential for recycling when replaced or decommissioned. The U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) provides a summary of information currently available (EPA 2023a) and is in\nthe process of developing new administrative rules (EPA 2023b). The EPA is developing a proposal to\nadd hazardous waste solar panels to federal universal waste regulations (40 CFR 273) and to establish a\nnew category of universal waste specifically for lithium batteries. The Applicant and its contractors would\nadhere to current best practices and regulations concerning the recycling of all Project materials.\n2.2.6 Termination and Reclamation\nThe Project would have a useful life of approximately 30 years. The Applicant would be required to post\na reclamation bond as a condition of the ROW authorizations. At the end of the useful life of the facility\nand the termination of the ROW grants, the Applicant would remove all Project components and\nfacilities. During this time, the site would remain fenced and gated. Materials that could be reused or\nrecycled would be hauled away from the site and sold. Materials that could not be reused or recycled\nwould be dismantled and hauled to the nearest approved landfill. Hazardous materials that could not be\nreused or recycled would be disposed of at approved facilities. The Applicant would remove foundations\nto 3 feet below ground surface, restore contours over the foundations similar to pre-Project conditions,\nremove any stormwater management berms (as needed), and restore the pre-Project contours to the\nmaximum extent possible. During these reclamation operations, it is anticipated that fugitive dust\n16\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nabatement measures comparable to those applied during construction would be implemented. Weed\ncontrol would also be implemented.\nThe gen-tie line and towers may be removed. Some structures and equipment may be required to remain\nin place based on final interconnection agreements. Conductors and tower steel would be sold for reuse or\nrecycling. The substation, including all structures and fencing, would be removed. If foundations extend\nfarther than 3 feet below grade, the portions of the foundations within 3 feet of the ground surface would\nbe removed, and contours would be restored.\nIt is not possible to predict the conditions and management objectives that would exist at the time of\ndecommissioning. Therefore, decommissioning details would be developed and provided to the BLM\nwhen the time for permanent closure is established and more information is available. The Restoration\nand Decommissioning Plan would describe general guidelines and standards for decommissioning. The\nplan would include all activities required to dispose of or store all hazardous and toxic materials and\nchemicals associated with the Project. This plan would discuss all currently applicable laws, ordinances,\nregulations, and standards associated with the safe storage or disposal of these materials. The plan would\nalso include a description of procedures for notification of regulatory agencies. The BLM would review\nand approve the plan prior to any decommissioning activities.\n2.2.7 Design Features, Stipulations, and Mitigation\nTable 2-6 includes a list of plans that the Applicant would prepare and implement as design features for\nthe Project. Stipulations for the Project have been developed from previous NEPA determinations, as\napplicable, including those identified in the following documents:\n\u2022 Western Solar Plan ROD (BLM 2012a)\n\u2022 Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a)\n\u2022 Regional Mitigation Strategy for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone (BLM 2014b)\n\u2022 Standard stipulations from the BLM Southern Nevada District Office (BLM 2023a)\nStipulations applicable to the Project have been organized into an overall list based on the documents\nfrom which they originate (Appendix E). The Regional Mitigation Strategy for the Project is included in\nAppendix B.\n2.2.8 Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed\nAnalysis\nFor an EA where there are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources, only\nthe Proposed Action requires consideration (BLM 2008). Other alternatives do not need to be analyzed. In\nthis EA, no unresolved conflicts with respect to alternative uses have been identified, and only the\nProposed Action and No Action Alternative are considered. No alternatives were developed to address\nissues or concerns raised by the public or agencies during scoping; however, design features were added\nto the Proposed Action based on scoping comments.\n17\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nCHAPTER 3. AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS\n3.1 INTRODUCTION AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS\nThis chapter identifies and describes the current conditions and trends of elements or resources in the\nhuman and natural environment which may be affected by the Proposed Action or the No Action\nAlternative. Chapter 3 also describes the potential environmental effects (impacts), including direct and\nindirect impacts, that may result from the Proposed Action or No Action Alternative. The effects analysis\naccounts for the design features and stipulations that are part of the Proposed Action (see Appendix E).\nAlthough final Project design may slightly change the discrete locations of Project elements, the maximum\ndisturbance acreage for each element (see Table 2-2) would not be exceeded during construction.\nImpacts can either be short term (temporary) or long term (permanent). Short term generally refers to\nimpacts during construction and up to 5 years after (through temporary disturbance restoration). Long\nterm generally refers to impacts lasting more than 5 years or for the life of the Project, which includes\ndisturbance associated with operations and maintenance and any impacts that may persist after\ndecommissioning. Additional information about impact duration is provided in each resource analysis, as\nnecessary.\n3.2 CUMULATIVE ACTIONS ANALYSIS\nThe cumulative actions analysis addresses the potential for cumulative impacts in the vicinity of the\nProject. Cumulative impacts are defined by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations as \u201cthe\nimpact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other\npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal)\nor person undertakes such other actions\u201d (40 CFR 1508.1(g)(3)).\nThe impacts of past and present actions are reflected in the affected environment for each resource\nanalyzed. Past and present actions considered include facilities/infrastructure currently existing or under\ndevelopment, such as electrical generation (solar, natural gas), transmission and distribution,\nroads/highways, railroads, industrial sites, landfills, etc. Reasonably foreseeable future actions are those\nprojects that are \u201csufficiently likely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into\naccount in reaching a decision (40 CFR 1508.1(aa)). A cumulative actions analysis is generally achieved\nthrough the following steps:\n\u2022 Establishment of the geographic scope and time frame of the analysis.\n\u2022 Identification of the cumulative effects associated with the project and alternatives in conjunction\nwith a list of reasonably foreseeable future actions or projects.\n\u2022 Analyzing the cumulative effects of the project when added to the effects of reasonably\nforeseeable future actions.\nThe geographic extent of impacts varies by resource area and the physical distance an impact may extend.\nThe time frame for the cumulative actions analysis includes those activities that are ongoing or would\noccur up to 30 years in the future (the length of the proposed Project ROW term).\nA cumulative analysis based on the geographic and temporal nature of the Project and its potential\nimpacts is provided under the section for each resource analyzed. A summary of the reasonably\nforeseeable future projects considered is provided in Table 3-1.\n18\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3 RESOURCE EVALUATION\nThe BLM Southern Nevada District Office resource specialists reviewed the Proposed Action and\nidentified resources that are present with potential for impact, present with no potential for impact, or not\npresent. Table 3-2 lists the resources considered in the evaluation of the Proposed Action and No Action\nalternative. Resources that may be affected by this proposal have been carried forward for analysis and\nare discussed further in this chapter. Figure 3-1 provides an overview of the different analysis areas for\neach resource or issue. Resources that are not present or not impacted by the Proposed Action (e.g.,\nimpacts are mitigated with the implementation of standard stipulations) will not be discussed further.\n3.3.1 Air Quality\n3.3.1.1 Introduction\nThis section describes air quality conditions that occur in and around the Project area. Project scoping\nidentified the following air quality issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would emissions from Project equipment and vehicles affect air quality, including emissions\nof fugitive dust?\n3.3.1.2 Analysis Area\nAir pollutants tend to disperse into the atmosphere, becoming less concentrated as they travel away from\na source of pollution, and therefore cannot be confined within defined boundaries, such as the boundary\nof a ROW or county lines. Because of the nature of air pollutants, the air quality analysis area is defined\nas the Project area plus a 5-mile buffer in all directions.\n3.3.1.3 Affected Environment\nThis section uses publicly available information to characterize existing air quality conditions and\nclimate. It is intended to provide context and a baseline against which Project-related impacts can be\nevaluated. Air quality in the analysis area is generally good. From January 1, 2023, through November\n27, 2023, the Air Quality Index at the nearest continuous monitoring site, the Walnut Community Center\nin Las Vegas, has been measured as good or moderate on more than 98% of days (EPA 2023d).\n3.3.1.3.1 CLEAN AIR ACT, NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS,\nAND REGIONAL HAZE RULE\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) was implemented to ensure acceptable and nonhazardous air quality for the\npeople of the United States. Subsequently, the EPA established the National Ambient Air Quality\nStandards for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, referred to as criteria\npollutants. The criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO ), sulfur dioxide\n2\n(SO ), particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM ), particulate matter with a diameter\n2 10\nof 2.5 microns or less (PM ), ozone, and lead. Unlike the rest of the criteria pollutants, ground-level\n2.5\nozone is typically not directly emitted into the atmosphere from an emissions source. Instead, ozone is\nformed when emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mix together in\nx\nthe presence of sunlight.\nOn January 6, 2023, the EPA announced a proposal to strengthen the PM standard to better protect\n2.5\nhuman health and the environment. The EPA is currently taking comments on the proposal to reduce the\ncurrent standard from 12 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) to a level between 8 and 11 \u00b5g/m3, to\nreflect the latest health data and scientific evidence to better protect communities (EPA 2023e).\n19\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nHazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are those known to cause cancer and other serious health impacts. The\nCAA requires the EPA to regulate HAPs, also known as air toxics, from categories of industrial facilities\nby developing standards for controlling emissions of air toxics known as maximum achievable control\ntechnology standards. There are no Project-specific applicable maximum achievable control technology\nrequirements regarding HAPs, as these standards only apply to stationary sources in specific industries.\nIn 1999, the EPA announced an effort to improve air quality and visibility in 156 national parks and\nwilderness areas designated as Class I, known as the Regional Haze Rule (EPA 1999). Regional haze\nreduces long-range visibility over a wide region. Section 169A of the CAA sets forth a national goal for\nvisibility. States are required to demonstrate reasonable progress toward the \u201cprevention of any future,\nand the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas which\nimpairment results from manmade air pollution.\u201d\nNational parks larger than 6,000 acres and national wilderness areas larger than 5,000 acres in existence\nwhen the 1977 amendments to the CAA were enacted have been designated as Class I areas. These areas\nhave additional protection for air quality and visibility by monitoring and limiting adverse impacts to air\nquality\u2013related values. All other areas are considered Class II areas. The nearest Class I area to the Project\narea is the Grand Canyon National Park located approximately 53 miles southeast of the Project.\n3.3.1.3.2 GENERAL CONFORMITY\nThe General Conformity Rule was established under Section 176(c)(4) of the CAA and ensures that\nfederal actions do not inhibit a state\u2019s attainment plans for areas designated as nonattainment or\nmaintenance. The rule effectively applies to all federal actions that take place in areas designated as\nnonattainment or maintenance. De minimis levels are emission thresholds for determining whether a\nGeneral Conformity determination must be performed. De minimis emission levels for criteria pollutants\nare established under the General Conformity Rule in 40 CFR 93.153 and are based on the severity of an\narea\u2019s air quality problem. The General Conformity Rule establishes more restrictive de minimis emission\nlevels for nonattainment areas and maintenance areas in ozone transport regions. Emissions below the de\nminimis level are assumed to have no serious impact to air quality and the activity is exempt.\nPortions of Clark County have been designated as a moderate nonattainment area for the 2015 8-hour\nozone and a maintenance area for CO and PM (EPA 2023f). The Project area is located outside the\n10\nnonattainment and maintenance areas; therefore, the General Conformity Rule does not apply.\n3.3.1.3.3 LOCAL AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Air Pollution Control regulates emissions\nfrom various sources through the Nevada Administrative Code Chapter 445B. Generally, any source that\nhas the potential to emit greater than 100 tons per year of any criteria pollutant is considered a Major\nClass I source. Within Clark County, emissions are regulated by the Clark County Department of\nEnvironment and Sustainability, Division of Air Quality (DAQ). Construction activities impacting greater\nthan 0.25 acre in Clark County require a Dust Control Operating Permit from DAQ. Projects larger than\n10 acres also require completion of a Dust Mitigation Plan Supplement for DAQ.\n3.3.1.3.4 NATIONAL EMISSIONS INVENTORY\nThe National Emissions Inventory is a detailed annual estimate of criteria pollutants and HAPs from air\nemission sources. Data are collected from state, local, and tribal air agencies and supplemented with data\nfrom the EPA (EPA 2023g). The National Emissions Inventory includes estimates of emissions from\nsources such as point sources, nonpoint sources, on-road sources, non-road sources, and event sources, to\ncreate as complete an inventory as possible. Point sources are sources of air pollutants located at a fixed\npoint, such as power plants, airports, and commercial sources. Nonpoint sources are those that are too\nsmall to pinpoint as point sources, such as asphalt paving, solvent use, and residential heating. On-road\n20\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nsources are emissions from on-road vehicles. Non-road sources are mobile sources of emissions that\noperate off road such as construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, trains, and emissions from\nbarges, ships, and other marine vessels. Event sources include emissions from sources such as wildfires.\nThe National Emissions Inventory is a reasonable estimate of how much each county and state is\ncontributing to air pollution for a given year. The National Emissions Inventory data for 2017 for Clark\nCounty are presented in Table 3-3, which shows that mobile emissions were the biggest contributors to\nCO, NO , and SO pollution and biogenic emissions were the biggest contributors to VOC and HAP\nx 2\npollution in Clark County. Dust was the biggest source of PM and PM pollution in Clark County.\n10 2.5\n3.3.1.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to air quality would occur. Existing conditions and trends would\ncontinue to affect air quality in the analysis area under this alternative. The land would remain available\nfor future solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.1.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThis section describes the potential impacts to air quality associated with the construction, operations and\nmaintenance, and decommissioning of the Project. Impacts to air quality are discussed in terms of Project\nemissions of criteria pollutants and HAPs. The analysis takes into account the design features,\nstipulations, and mitigation incorporated into the Proposed Action to reduce potential Project impacts (see\nSection 2.2.7 and Appendix E).\n3.3.1.5.1 METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS\nEmissions calculations for the Project were divided into construction-related emissions (those emissions\nthat are expected to be temporary in nature) and operational-related emissions (those emissions that are\nexpected to occur throughout the operational lifetime of the Project). Construction-related emissions\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 Exhaust from on- and off-road construction vehicles and equipment.\n\u2022 Exhaust from on-road construction worker commuter vehicles.\n\u2022 Exhaust from on-road construction material and equipment delivery vehicles.\n\u2022 Fugitive dust from vehicle travel on paved and unpaved roads.\n\u2022 Fugitive dust from earthmoving and general construction activities.\nThe following assumptions were used to complete the air quality impact analysis for the Project:\n\u2022 Emissions from off-road construction equipment and vehicles, heavy-duty on-road construction\nequipment, construction worker commuting, on-road construction equipment, and equipment\ndelivery were estimated using EPA MOVES national average emission factors for 2022.\n\u2022 An estimated maximum number of 300 construction worker commuters are assumed to commute\nfrom Las Vegas (approximately 24 miles away).\n\u2022 Heavy-hauling trucks would be used to deliver materials and equipment from Las Vegas.\n\u2022 Concrete trucks would be used for 14 months commuting from Las Vegas.\n\u2022 Fugitive dust emissions from vehicle travel on paved and unpaved roads were estimated using\nEPA emission factor calculations (Sections 13.2.1 and 13.2.2 in Compilation of Air Pollutant\nEmissions Factors (AP-42) [EPA 2006, 2011]).\n21\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n\u2022 Fugitive dust emissions from earthmoving were estimated using the Western Regional Air\nPartnership\u2019s (WRAP) Fugitive Dust Handbook (WRAP 2006).\n3.3.1.5.2 CONSTRUCTION EFFECTS\nConstruction activities would result in air pollutant emissions from equipment exhaust during\nconstruction, vehicle exhaust caused by travel to and from the Project area, and fugitive dust from soil\ndisturbance. Fugitive dust emissions would be mitigated to the extent practicable through implementation\nof dust control measures and best management practices as required by Clark County and defined in the\nProject\u2019s Dust Abatement Plan (e.g., construction dust control monitoring, soil stabilization through use\nof measures such as water and dust suppressant application or cessation of construction activities during\nhigh wind conditions). Table 3-4 presents the estimated annual criteria pollutant, VOC, and HAP\nemissions that would occur from construction. It was assumed that construction could last up to 2 years.\nTable 3-4 presents the estimated annual Project construction emissions that would be emitted each year\nfor a 2-year construction period. Overall, the annual pollutants emitted from Project construction would\nbe much smaller than Clark County\u2019s total projected annual emissions. The Project\u2019s construction\nemissions equal, at most, 0.47% of Clark County\u2019s total emission inventory for a given pollutant.\nConstruction emissions would be temporary and transient in nature. Construction of the Project would\nhave short-term air quality impacts, occurring only during the duration of the construction phase.\n3.3.1.5.3 OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EFFECTS\nOperations and maintenance activities would occur after the completion of construction and throughout\nthe life of the solar facility. These activities would include inspections by passenger truck, vegetation\nmanagement, routine maintenance, and damage repair, but would not include any future major upgrades\nor rebuilds. Operations and maintenance emissions are anticipated to be considerably less than\nconstruction emissions. The estimated maximum potential emissions per year from operations and\nmaintenance\u2013related activities are summarized in Table 3-5 and consist of the following:\n\u2022 Emissions from inspection activities such as exhaust from on-road inspection vehicles and\nfugitive dust from travel on paved and unpaved roads.\n\u2022 Emissions from maintenance activities, including exhaust from worker vehicles and any needed\nequipment, as well as fugitive dust from travel on paved and unpaved roads.\nEmissions from vehicle travel during operations and maintenance would be minimal, and mileage for\nvehicle travel to the solar facility for routine inspection would be much less than during construction.\nEmissions from vehicle exhaust during operations and maintenance would be lower than the emissions\ngenerated by construction. The greatest impact due to operations and maintenance activities is, at most,\n0.02% of Clark County\u2019s annual emission inventory for a given pollutant.\nThe Project area is not subject to the General Conformity Rule. However, for attainment areas, comparing\nestimated Project emissions to the established maintenance area de minimis thresholds is a possible\nquality impact indicator. The estimated annual Project operations and maintenance emissions are well\nbelow the maintenance area de minimis thresholds (EPA 2023h) and, therefore, the Project would not\nhave consequential impacts to air quality.\n3.3.1.5.3.1 Avoided Emissions\nThe use of the sun to generate electricity reduces the need to generate electricity from traditional fossil\nfuel\u2013powered plants that produce air pollutant emissions. The estimated avoided emissions by generating\nelectricity via the Project instead of traditional fossil fuel\u2013powered plants were calculated using the\nEPA\u2019s AVERT Excel Edition, Version 4.1 for the Northwest region based on EPA\u2019s 2022 regional data\n22\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nfile. The EPA\u2019s AVERT is not a long-term projection tool and is not intended to analyze avoided\nemissions for more than 5 years from baseline. The estimated annual and 5-year long-term total avoided\nemissions are based on the 200-MW design capacity of the Project. To provide a rough estimate of the\nlong-term avoided emissions of the Project, the annual avoided emissions estimated by AVERT were\nmultiplied by 5 years. As presented in Table 3-6, the Project would annually displace carbon dioxide\n(CO ), NO , SO , PM , VOCs, and ammonia (NH ) produced by the Nevada electric grid and decrease\n2 x 2 2.5 3\nthe creation of air pollutant emissions in the atmosphere from traditional fossil fuel\u2013fired power plants.\n3.3.1.5.4 DECOMMISSIONING EFFECTS\nDuring decommissioning, the Project would create the same or fewer emissions as during construction;\ntherefore, impacts to air quality from decommissioning would be less than or equal to the impacts to air\nquality during construction.\n3.3.1.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for air quality is the same as the analysis area described in Section\n3.3.1.2. Cumulative effects on air quality from the development of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). Project impacts to air quality\nin the form of criteria pollutants and HAPs would be generated from vehicular exhaust and the\ndisturbance of dust from construction areas. Most of the existing projects and reasonably foreseeable\nactions identified in Table 3-1 are development and transmission line projects. These projects would more\npredominantly produce particulate matter (PM and PM ) from the disturbance of land but would also\n10 2.5\nemit criteria pollutants from equipment and vehicle exhaust.\nThe impacts of Project emissions would be low compared to Clark County\u2019s existing emissions, as shown\nin Table 3-3 and Table 3-4. Construction activities are temporary and transient in nature, and therefore\nimpacts from these types of activities would be short term and localized to the construction area.\nConstruction cumulative impacts, if any, would only occur if construction occurred at the same time and\ngeographically near any of the actions listed in Table 3-1. Air pollution associated with the Project\u2019s\nlong\u2011term operations and maintenance would cumulatively impact air quality but would be much lower\nthan during the construction phase (less than 0.02% of Clark County\u2019s annual emission inventory for all\nevaluated pollutants).\nAir quality in the region could be improved in the long term because additional renewable generation\nwould offset emissions from fossil fuel\u2013generated energy sources. Considering the comparatively low\npotential emissions from the Project, as well as the intermittent nature of the emissions generated from\npresent and reasonably foreseeable impacts, Project cumulative impacts may have a long-term small\nbeneficial impact to air quality due to reduced reliance on fossil fuel\u2013generated energy sources.\n3.3.2 Climate Change\nGlobal evidence indicates that the earth\u2019s climate is changing. This evidence includes increases in ocean\ntemperatures, sea level, and acidity; the melting of glaciers and sea ice; changing temperature and\nprecipitation patterns; changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events; and\nshifts in ecosystem characteristics such as the migration of birds. These changes are caused by a buildup\nof greenhouse gases (GHGs) in our atmosphere and the warming of the planet (EPA 2022). Key GHGs\nconsist of CO , methane (CH ), nitrous oxide (N O), and F-gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and\n2 4 2\nperfluorocarbons.\nProject scoping identified the following climate change issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the operation of Project equipment and vehicles contribute to GHG emissions?\n23\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.2.1 Analysis Area\nDue to the nature of GHGs, which become more spread out as they travel away from a source of\npollution, a GHG analysis area has not been defined.\n3.3.2.2 Affected Environment\nClimate change is a global issue that results from several factors, including the release of GHGs, land use\nmanagement practices, and the albedo effect, or reflectivity of various surfaces (including reflectivity of\nclouds). Specific to the Project, GHGs are produced and emitted by various sources during the\ndevelopment and operational phases of solar arrays, transmission lines, and substations. The primary\nsources of GHGs associated with solar facilities are CO , CH and N O from fuel combustion in\n2 4, 2\nconstruction and maintenance vehicles and equipment, as well as operational emissions of sulfur\nhexafluoride (SF ) associated with potential leakage from gas-insulated circuit breakers at the substation.\n6\nEstimates of GHG emissions are usually reported in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) to account\n2\nfor the relative global warming potential (GWP), i.e., a given pollutant\u2019s ability to trap heat. GWP is\ncalculated over a specific time, typically 100 years. For example, according to the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al. 2021), methane has a GWP of\n29.8 over 100 years, meaning it is 29.8 times more effective at trapping heat than CO . N O has a GWP of\n2 2\n273 over 100 years, meaning it is 273 times more effective at trapping heat than CO . SF has a GWP of\n2 6\n25,200 over 100 years, meaning it is 25,200 times more effective at trapping heat than CO .\n2\nAn analysis of regional climate impacts prepared by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Hicke et al.\n2022) concludes that the rate of warming in the American Southwest was among the most rapid\nnationally. This warming is causing a decline in spring snowpack and reducing flow in the four major\nSouthwest rivers. The projections of future climate change indicate that further strong warming would\nreduce precipitation. Analysis of past records and future projections indicate an overall increase in\nregional temperatures. The increase is largely the result of warmer nights and effectively higher average\ndaily minimum temperatures at many observed sites in the region.\n3.3.2.2.1 EMISSION INVENTORIES\nThe most recently available data on GHG emissions in the United States indicate that annual GHG\nemissions in 2021 were an estimated 5,586.0 million metric tons after accounting for sequestration (EPA\n2023i). Individually, in 2020, 40.8 million metric tons of GHGs were emitted in Nevada. Total GHG\nemissions for the United States have been on the decline over the past decade (EPA 2023j). The National\nEmissions Inventory GHG data for 2017 for Clark County are presented in Table 3-7, which shows that\nmobile emissions were the biggest contributors to CO and N O pollution and fuel combustion emissions\n2 2\nwere the biggest contributors to methane pollution in Clark County.\n3.3.2.2.2 SOCIAL COST OF GREENHOUSE GASES\nThe \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d \u201csocial cost of nitrous oxide,\u201d and \u201csocial cost of methane\u201d (together, the\n\u201csocial cost of greenhouse gases\u201d [SC-GHG]) are estimates of the monetized damages associated with\nincremental increases in GHG emissions in a given year.\nOn January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden issued EO 13990, Protecting Public Health and the\nEnvironment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis. Section 2 of the EO calls for federal\nagencies to review existing regulations and policies issued between January 20, 2017, and January 20,\n2021, for consistency with the policy articulated in the EO and to take appropriate action. Thus, the CEQ\nrescinded its 2019 Draft National Environmental Policy Act Guidance on Considering Greenhouse Gas\nEmissions (CEQ 2021) and has begun to review (with the purpose of updating) its Final Guidance for\n24\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nFederal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of\nClimate Change in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews issued on August 5, 2016 (2016 GHG\nGuidance) (CEQ 2016). Although CEQ works on updated guidance, it has instructed agencies to consider\nand use all tools and resources available to them in assessing GHG emissions and climate change effects,\nincluding the 2016 GHG Guidance.\nSection 5 of EO 13990 emphasized how important it is for federal agencies to \u201ccapture the full costs of\ngreenhouse gas emissions as accurately as possible, including by taking global damages into account\u201d and\nestablished an Interagency Working Group on the SC-GHG (IWG). In February of 2021, the IWG\npublished Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide: Interim\nEstimates under Executive Order 13990 (IWG 2021). This is an interim report that updated previous\nguidance from 2016.\nThe CEQ released new interim guidance on January 9, 2023, regarding GHGs and climate change in the\nNEPA process (88 Federal Register 1196\u20131212 [January 9, 2023]). This interim guidance recommends\nthat context for the GHG emissions and climate impacts associated with a proposed action be\ndemonstrated by calculating estimated SC-GHG. However, the 2016 GHG Guidance noted that NEPA\ndoes not require monetizing costs and benefits. It also noted that \u201cthe weighing of the merits and\ndrawbacks of the various alternatives need not be displayed using a monetary cost-benefit analysis and\nshould not be when there are important qualitative considerations\u201d (CEQ 2016).\nFor this EA, only direct Project emissions were able to be quantified. At this time, it is too speculative to\nestimate the indirect impacts from the Project such as variations in power demand, quantity of renewable\nenergy delivered to power grid, and offset of fossil fuel\u2013based power generation emissions from\nrenewable energy delivery. Without the ability to calculate the benefits of GHG reductions achieved from\nthe Project\u2019s renewable energy generation, the SC-GHG analysis is based solely on direct Project\nemissions and, thus, is skewed and does not accurately represent the net carbon balance from the full life\ncycle of the Project. Therefore, the SC-GHG estimates in this EA are provided only as a form of context\nfor GHG emissions, which is consistent with the CEQ interim guidance on analyzing GHGs.\n3.3.2.3 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to climate change would occur. Existing climate change trends\nwould continue under this alternative. The land would remain available for future solar energy projects\nbecause of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.2.4 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThis section describes the potential impacts to GHG emissions and climate change associated with the\nconstruction, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning of the Project. The analysis takes into\naccount the design features, stipulations, and mitigation incorporated into the Proposed Action to reduce\npotential Project impacts (see Section 2.2.7 and Appendix E).\n3.3.2.4.1 METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS\nEmissions calculations for the Project were divided into construction-related emissions (those emissions\nthat are expected to be temporary in nature) and operational-related emissions (those emissions that are\nexpected to occur throughout the operational lifetime of the Project). Construction-related emissions\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 Exhaust from on- and off-road construction vehicles and equipment.\n\u2022 Exhaust from on-road construction worker commuter vehicles.\n25\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n\u2022 Exhaust from on-road construction material and equipment delivery vehicles.\nThe following assumptions were used to complete the GHG and climate impact analysis for the Project:\n\u2022 Emissions from off-road construction equipment and vehicles, heavy-duty on-road construction\nequipment, construction worker commuting, on-road construction equipment, and equipment\ndelivery were estimated using EPA MOVES national average emission factors for 2022.\n\u2022 An estimated maximum number of 300 construction worker commuters are assumed to commute\nfrom Las Vegas (approximately 24 miles away).\n\u2022 Heavy-hauling trucks would be used to deliver materials and equipment from Las Vegas.\n\u2022 Concrete trucks would be used for 14 months commuting from Las Vegas.\n\u2022 Construction and operational emissions were estimated using published and agency-accepted\nemission factors, such as AP-42 emission factors when appropriate, to estimate GHG emissions.\n\u2022 SF -containing equipment used a leak rate of 0.5%.\n6\nThe SC-GHGs associated with estimated emissions represent the present value of future market and\nnonmarket costs associated with CO , CH , and N O emissions. This SC-GHG analysis was prepared in\n2 4 2\nconsideration of guidance issued by the CEQ on January 9, 2023, which includes quantifying the\nprojected GHG emissions for the expected lifetime of the Project, in addition to the best available\nSC-GHG estimates (CEQ 2023). Estimates are calculated based on IWG estimates of social cost per\nmetric ton of emissions for a given emissions year and the estimates of emissions in each year. They are\nrounded to the nearest $1,000. These estimates assume development would start in 2024 and end-use\nemissions would be complete in 2056.\n3.3.2.4.2 CONSTRUCTION EFFECTS\nConstruction activities would result in GHG emissions from equipment exhaust and vehicle exhaust\ncaused by travel to and from the Project disturbance areas. Table 3-8 presents the estimated annual GHG\nemissions that would occur from Project construction.\n3.3.2.4.3 OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EFFECTS\nOperations and maintenance activities would occur after the completion of construction and throughout\nthe life of the solar facility. These activities would include inspections by passenger truck, vegetation\nmanagement, routine maintenance, and damage repair, but would not include any future major upgrades\nor rebuilds. Operations and maintenance GHG emissions are anticipated to be considerably less than\nconstruction GHG emissions. The estimated maximum potential GHG emissions per year from operations\nand maintenance\u2013related activities are summarized in Table 3-9 and include the following:\n\u2022 Emissions from inspection activities such as exhaust from on-road inspection vehicles.\n\u2022 Emissions from maintenance activities, including exhaust from worker vehicles and any needed\nequipment.\n\u2022 Emissions of SF from operation of any new SF -containing equipment.\n6 6\nIt was assumed that new SF -containing equipment containing up to 3,422 pounds of SF would be\n6 6\ninstalled for the Project. A manufacturer\u2019s leak rate of 0.5% per year was assumed, meaning a maximum\nof 17.11 pounds (0.00776 metric tons) of SF was assumed to leak each year. This is equivalent to 196\n6\nmetric tons of CO e.\n2\nGHG emissions from the operations and maintenance of the Project (including potential SF leaks from\n6\ncircuit breakers) would result in 2,803 metric tons of CO e being emitted each year for the duration of the\n2\n26\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nProject. This is equivalent to the GHG emissions from 624 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven\nfor 1 year (EPA 2023k). The largest impact in terms of GHG emissions resulting from annual operations\nand maintenance activities could equal up to 0.01% of Clark County\u2019s total emission inventory for CO e\n2\nannually. The Project would facilitate the delivery of renewable energy to the power grid, thus offsetting\nfossil fuel generation and resulting in a net reduction of GHG emissions. The long-term beneficial impact\nof the Project would be the reduction of GHGs compared to providing the same amount of power via\nfossil fuel combustion.\n3.3.2.4.3.1 Avoided Emissions\nAs presented in Table 3-6, the Project would annually displace CO as well as other non-GHG pollutants\n2\nproduced by the Nevada electric grid and decrease the creation of air pollutant emissions in the\natmosphere from traditional fossil fuel\u2013fired power plants. The amount of CO emissions that the Project\n2\nwould avoid annually (314,068 tons or 284,918 metric tons) is equivalent to the GHG emissions from\n63,403 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles removed from the road for 1 year or the CO emissions from\n2\n0.076 coal-fired power plants in 1 year (EPA 2023k).\n3.3.2.4.4 DECOMMISSIONING EFFECTS\nDuring decommissioning the Project would create the same or fewer emissions as during construction;\ntherefore, impacts to GHGs and climate change from decommissioning would be less than or equal to the\nimpacts to GHGs and climate change during construction.\n3.3.2.4.5 SC-GHG EFFECTS\nTable 3-10 provides estimates of the monetary value of changes in GHG emissions that could result from\nthe Proposed Action construction, 30 years of operations, and decommissioning (decommissioning was\nassumed to have emissions equivalent to half of the total construction emissions). Due to the limitations\nof AVERT, the emissions that the Project would avoid if the same amount of energy were generated via\nthe combustion of fossil fuels has not been accounted for in the SC-GHG analysis. This analysis should\nnot be construed to mean a cost determination is necessary to address potential impacts of GHGs. These\nnumbers were monetized; however, they do not constitute a complete cost-benefit analysis, nor do the\nSC-GHG numbers present a direct comparison with other impacts analyzed in this document. SC-GHG is\nprovided only as a form of context for GHG emissions, consistent with the CEQ interim guidance on\nanalyzing GHGs.\n3.3.2.5 Cumulative Effects\nCumulative effects on climate change from the development of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). Project impacts to climate\nchange in the form of GHG emissions are generated from vehicular exhaust. Most of the existing projects\nand reasonably foreseeable actions identified in Table 3-1 are development and transmission line projects.\nThese projects would also emit GHGs from equipment vehicle exhaust.\nImpacts to climate change result from emissions of GHGs accumulating in the atmosphere, rather than\nlocalized emissions. Cumulative impacts would occur from emissions of GHGs associated with Project\nactivities and emissions of GHGs from existing and future area projects adding to the amount of GHGs in\nthe atmosphere. However, the Project and other renewable energy projects in the area would help meet\nclimate change goals and would avoid emissions when compared to generating an equivalent amount of\nenergy from fossil fuel combustion.\nIn addition to the impacts of the Project on climate change, there is also the potential that climate change\ncould impact the Project. Impacts to the construction phase of the Project from climate change could\n27\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nresult in economic concerns due to extreme weather events that cause increased occurrences of severe\nflooding or drought conditions and may lead to schedule disruptions or the need for more sustainable\nconstruction materials. Potential impacts to the operations and maintenance phase of the Project from\nclimate change could include economic concerns due to extreme weather events that result in severe\nflooding or storms that have the potential to damage the solar facility, transmission line, or other\ninfrastructure and increase the needed frequency of maintenance. However, drainage and flood control\nstructures would be implemented to minimize future flood risk (see Section 3.3.11).\n3.3.3 Cultural Resources\n3.3.3.1 Introduction\nCultural resources are generally defined as physical manifestations (human-made and natural features)\nassociated with past or extant cultures that are, in most cases, finite, unique, fragile, and nonrenewable.\nThese resources include prehistoric and historic-era archaeological sites, historic buildings and structures\n(architectural), and the locations of important historic events. Cultural resources may also refer to places\nthat are areas of traditional religious and cultural importance, including archaeological sites, landscapes,\nnatural landforms, or small, discrete use areas important to the practice and continuity of traditional\npractices, or necessary for maintaining a community\u2019s cultural identity.\nProject scoping identified the following cultural resources issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would cultural resources be affected by the proposed Project?\n3.3.3.2 Analysis Area\nAs defined under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the area of potential\neffects (APE) is a geographic area or areas within which impacts from an undertaking may directly or\nindirectly affect cultural resources that are listed in or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places\n(NRHP) (i.e., historic properties). As the lead federal agency, the BLM defined the APE, in consultation\nwith the Section 106 consulting parties, by considering potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts\nto cultural resources from the construction, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning of the Project.\nThe analysis area for physical effects is defined as the 1,801-acre physical APE. The analysis area for\nvisual, auditory, and atmospheric (VAA) effects is defined as the VAA APE, consisting of any areas\ndetermined through viewshed analysis to have a direct line of sight to and from the Project within a\n5-mile radius. Auditory and atmospheric effects would be intermittent and/or temporary and generally\nconfined to the work areas in the physical APE. Project impacts to cultural resources would be permanent\nunless avoidance is possible or mitigation occurs.\nThese two analysis areas account for potential physical and other impacts from implementation of the\nProject that could result in adverse effects on historic properties (i.e., cultural resources that qualify for\nthe NRHP as defined under 36 CFR 800.5(a)(1) (Criteria of Adverse Effect).\n3.3.3.3 Affected Environment\nThe physical APE is in the southern Dry Lake Valley south of the Dry Lake alkali flat. Falling within the\nsoutheastern Great Basin, the Project area is situated at the nexus of several overlapping culture areas,\nincluding the Ancestral Puebloan, Patayan, and Numic traditions. During the Post-Puebloan period, the\nDry Lake Valley was occupied by the Southern Paiute. Since prehistoric times, the area functioned as a\nwell-trafficked transportation corridor used by travelers along trails established by Native Americans, and\nthen by early explorers and settlers along routes such as the Old Spanish Trail/Mormon Wagon Road.\nLater routes included U.S. 91/Arrowhead Trail and the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake (SP, LA &\n28\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nSL) (later known as the Union Pacific) Railroad. Railroad camps and sidings, such as Garnet, were\nestablished along the main line during railroad construction in the early 1900s. The area also saw limited\nmining with the discovery of limestone deposits and establishment of the Apex District. Today, the\nphysical APE continues to serve as a major transportation and utility corridor, with I-15 and the Union\nPacific Railroad (UPRR) forming the western and eastern boundaries. Additional detail on prehistory\n(e.g., Early Archaic period, Middle Archaic period, Late Archaic period), ethnohistory (e.g., Southern\nPaiute), and history (e.g., the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition, mining, railroads) in the general area is\nprovided in the Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Solar Energy Development in\nSix Southwestern States (BLM and DOE 2010:11.3-279\u201311.3-285).\nTo identify and document cultural resources present in the analysis area, a BLM Class III cultural\nresources inventory was conducted for the physical APE (McMurry et al. 2023). The inventory\nencompassed 1,801 acres of BLM-administered and Clark County\u2013managed lands to evaluate potential\neffects from the Project. The results of the inventory, which consisted of an archival literature review and\nan intensive Class III pedestrian survey, are briefly summarized below.\nIn all, the inventory identified 43 cultural resource sites within the extent of the physical APE. Of the 43\narchaeological sites recorded during the inventory, 34 were determined not eligible for listing on the\nNRHP. Another two sites were determined to be non-contributing segments of NRHP-eligible or listed\nsites (26CK3848 and 26CK4429/26CK5685). Site 26CK3848 is the Old Spanish Trail/Mormon Wagon\nRoad, a historically significant route associated with early exploration and settlement of the West. The\nsite is currently listed in the NRHP under Criterion A for its association with the historic themes of\nTransportation and Exploration/Settlement for the period of significance of 1844\u20131857. Some segments\nhave been additionally recommended eligible under Criterion D because of research potential of\nassociated artifact scatters or features such as wheel ruts or wear on rocks. The segment recorded for the\ncurrent Project passes through an extensively disturbed transportation and utility corridor in southern Dry\nLake Valley along the west side of I-15. The trail segment is barely distinguishable from the surrounding\ndesert and was recommended as a non-contributing element to the overall site due to lack of integrity.\nSite 26CK4429/26CK5685 is the historic UPRR. Originally constructed between 1903 and 1905, the\nrailroad has operated at various times as the SP, LA & SL and the UPRR. The overall site has been\npreviously recommended eligible for the NRHP under all criteria; however, the segment recorded in the\nProject area was recommended as a non-contributing element because most of the railroad components\nhave been upgraded or modified and most of the original materials have been replaced for purposes of\nroutine maintenance, technological advancement, and public safety, resulting in a lack of integrity.\nSeven sites (six eligible sites and one unevaluated site) within the physical APE constitute historic\nproperties. Six sites were determined eligible for the NRHP: a segment of historic U.S. 91/Arrowhead\nTrail (26CK4369/26CK4958), a historic shoofly railroad berm (26CK4786), the historic Garnet\nConstruction Camp (26CK4787), and three additional unnamed railroad construction camps\n(26CK6122/26CK6814, 26CK11450, and 26CK11476). A prehistoric rockshelter (26CK1207), which\nremains unevaluated, will be treated as eligible under Criterion D for its information value, and the key\nelements of the site would be avoided by the Project design.\nThe VAA effects analysis (McMurry 2023) identified a total of eight historic properties/unevaluated\nresources that would be potentially sensitive to VAA impacts from the Project, specifically visual\nintrusions. This count includes five resources located outside the physical APE: the Sheep Mountain\nRange Archeological District (NR 74001145), two prehistoric rockshelters (26CK1172 and 26CK1208), a\nrailroad industrial site (26CK2131), and an alignment of the Mormon Wagon Road (26CK6115). The\nother three resources consist of linear sites located both within the physical APE and the other effects\nanalysis area: the Old Spanish Trail/Mormon Wagon Road (26CK3848), U.S. 91/Arrowhead Trails\nHighway (26CK4369/26CK4958), and the UPRR/SP, LA & SL (26CK4429/26CK5865/S2460/S2520).\n29\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nBased on key observation point (KOP) analysis, the proposed Project would be visible from previously\nrecorded segments of three of these resources (26CK3848, 26CK4429, and 26CK6115).\nA review of historic maps indicated six potential historic features outside the physical APE but within the\nVAA effects analysis area: a post office, a railroad stop, an airway beacon, the Garnet railroad siding, the\nArrolime railroad siding, and the Dry Lake railroad siding. However, ground-truthing revealed no historic\nstructures associated with these features were extant, and it is likely that these features have all been\ndestroyed.\n3.3.3.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to cultural resources would occur in the physical APE or other\neffects analysis areas. Current conditions and trends would continue. The land would remain available for\nfuture solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.3.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThe Proposed Action would result in physical impacts to four historic properties, consisting of a shoofly\nrailroad (26CK4786), the historic Garnet construction camp (26CK4787), and two additional unnamed\nhistoric railroad construction camps (26CK6122/26CK6814 and 26CK11450). The remaining two eligible\nsites (26CK4369/26CK4958 [Arrowhead Trail], and 26CK11476 [historic railroad construction camp])\nand single unevaluated site (26CK1207 [prehistoric rockshelter]) are in areas that would be fully avoided\nby ground-disturbing activities. Adverse effects on historic properties would be minimized through the\nimplementation of required programmatic design features described in Appendix A of the Western Solar\nPlan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012) and through the Project\u2019s Cultural Resources Management Plan, which\nincludes measures such as implementation of a worker environmental awareness program, monitoring\nduring construction, and an unanticipated discovery plan. Adverse impacts would be resolved through the\ndevelopment and implementation of a Memorandum of Agreement in consultation with the Section 106\nconsulting parties.\nBased on results of the VAA analysis, it was recommended that development of the Proposed Action\nwould not result in any adverse effects to the setting of historic properties located in the Project viewshed,\nalthough this finding is pending review by Section 106 consulting parties. KOP analysis indicated the\nvisual setting of the physical APE and VAA effects analysis areas has been heavily altered due to\nnumerous existing solar facilities, transmission and highway corridors, the modern I-15, a truck stop/gas\nstation complex, a pig farm, and other modern infrastructure. The Project is no larger in scope or\ndisturbance compared to previously completed construction and is unlikely to represent a consequential\nimpact or intrusion to the visual setting of any historic properties.\n3.3.3.6 Cumulative Effects\nCumulative effects on cultural resources would generally be similar to those described in the Dry Lake\nEast DLA EA (BLM 2019a:24\u201325) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). The\ncumulative effects analysis area is defined as the VAA APE. Existing developments, namely energy\ntransmission and industrial projects, in the analysis area have cumulatively impacted the visual setting of\nhistoric properties such as the Old Spanish Trail within the Project viewshed. Cultural resources similar to\nthose identified within the physical APE have been physically impacted in the analysis area. Specifically,\nthe initial development of the APEX Industrial Park in the 1990s resulted in impacts to the historical\nlandscape and viewshed of the UPRR, associated sidings, and construction camps along the historic\nrailroad alignment. Additionally, enhanced public access due to these projects have increased recreational\n30\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nactivity in the analysis area, resulting in all-terrain vehicle activity, use of the area for unauthorized\nfirearm practice, and unauthorized collection of cultural resources (i.e., bottle hunters).\nReasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect cultural resources in the analysis area\ninclude APEX Industrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex Generating Station to\nCrystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System, Greenlink West\nTransmission Project, Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, and the Chuckwalla Solar Projects. Cumulatively,\nthese projects could disturb up to 21,485 acres of land in the cultural resources analysis area. These\nprojects would result in the landscape becoming increasingly dominated by energy and industrial\ndevelopment and could result in cumulative impacts to the setting and the feeling of historic properties in\nthe Project viewshed, such as the Old Spanish Trail. Development of the reasonably foreseeable future\nactions could also result in physical impacts to cultural resources within their footprints, some of which\nmay be similar types to those identified in the physical APE (e.g., historical railroad camps). Cumulative\nimpacts to cultural resources would be mitigated using strategies outlined in a Memorandum of\nAgreement in consultation with the Section 106 consulting parties.\n3.3.3.7 Mitigation Measures\nImpacts to cultural resources would be mitigated using strategies outlined in a Memorandum of\nAgreement in consultation with the Section 106 consulting parties.\n3.3.4 Fuels and Fire Risk\n3.3.4.1 Introduction\nThis section provides an overview of the local fuel load and fire risk in the fire behavior analysis area, as\nwell as fire history in the Project area. Project scoping identified the following fuels and fire risk issue for\ndetailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project change local fuel loads and affect fire risk?\n3.3.4.2 Analysis Area\nFor fuels and fire risk, the analysis area was assessed at two scales: the Project area (approximately 1,683\nacres) and the Project area plus a 2.5-mile buffer, hereafter referred to as the fire behavior analysis area\n(approximately 32,069.8 acres). The fire behavior analysis area accounts for the extent of the area that\nmay experience some level of disturbance or change from existing conditions due to development of the\nProject. Impacts to the fire environment would last until Project termination and reclamation is complete\n(the Project has a life of approximately 30 years).\nThe Nevada Natural Resources and Fire Information Portal (Nevada Division of Forestry 2023), the\nNational Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) (2023), Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) (2023), the\nInteragency Fuel Treatment Decision Support System (2023), and the U.S. Forest Service (2022)\nGeospatial Data Discovery portal were used to compile fire history, fuels, and fire behavior data across\nthe analysis areas. Fuels management information on federal lands was compiled from the Las Vegas\nRMP (BLM 1998) and the updated BLM Southern Nevada District Office Resource Fire Management\nPlan (BLM 2023b).\n3.3.4.3 Affected Environment\nThe fire behavior analysis area has been influenced by past and current environmental trends and human\nactivities. These factors create fluctuations in fuels, weather, and sources of ignitions, and subsequently in\n31\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nfire risk. Past and current trends, management, and land use that are affecting the existing fire\nenvironment consist of the following:\n\u2022 Climate change\n\u2022 Fuels and vegetation management\n\u2022 Fire suppression activities from past wildfires\n\u2022 Construction of electrical infrastructure (transmission lines, solar arrays, and BESS), maintenance\nof existing electrical features (BESS), and construction and maintenance of linear features (e.g.,\nother transmission lines, access roads, and highways)\nThe Project is in the Mojave Basin and Range Level III ecoregion (Bryce et al. 2003), which occurs\nthroughout southern Nevada. This ecoregion is characterized by broad basins with scattered mountains.\nCreosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is the dominant vegetation and fuel type in the ecoregion. In general,\nthis ecoregion is dry and has vegetation cover that ranges from 2% to 50% (NatureServe 2022). The\nProject area and fire behavior analysis area are characterized by the Sonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White\nBursage Desert Scrub vegetative community (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] 2005a), with 96.2% of the\nProject area characterized by this community (see Section 3.3.9). Historic fire return intervals in creosote\nbush communities are typically very long, with the fire return interval (FRI) estimated at over 650 years\n(NatureServe 2022). The long FRI is due to open canopy shrub structure and discontinuous fuel layers.\nHistorically, large fires typically occurred following a wet year that spurred the growth of fine fuels.\nNonnative grasses, such as compact brome (Bromus madritensis) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) are\nresulting in heavier fuel loads in this vegetative community and are shortening FRIs (NatureServe 2022).\n3.3.4.3.1 FIRE HISTORY\nFire history was assessed within a 10-mile buffer around the Project area (the fire management area).\nDetailed fire history data for the fire management area were only available from 2014 to 2022 (MTBS\n2023) (Table 3-11). Less detailed fire data, but fire data that captured larger fires (greater than 500 acres)\nin the fire management area, are available from 2004 to 2022 (NIFC 2023) (Table 3-12). There were no\nfires greater than 500 acres in the fire management area from 2007 to 2022.\nBetween 2014 and 2022, 67 fires occurred in the fire management area (see Table 3-11). Of these fires,\n49 were human caused and 18 had an unknown or undetermined cause (MTBS 2023). There were three\nfires greater than 10 acres between 2014 and 2022; no fire was larger than 37 acres. The remaining fires\nwere all less than 10 acres. Most fires were less than 0.25 acre. Although recent years show minor fire\nactivity in terms of the number of fires and fire size, the region can experience larger wildfires. In 2004,\n2005, and 2006, the fire management area experienced heightened fire activity during, with eight fires\nburning over 49,000 acres (see Table 3-12). Data on specific causes are incomplete, but most ignitions\nhave been attributed to humans from sources such as vehicles, fireworks, and firearms (NIFC 2023).\n3.3.4.3.2 FUELS\nFuel models in the fire behavior analysis area were taken from the Natural Resources and Fire\nInformation Portal (Nevada Division of Forestry 2023) (via LANDFIRE [2023]). Fuel model summaries\nin the fire behavior analysis area can be found in Table 3-13. The fuels in the fire behavior analysis area\nwere classified using Scott and Burgan\u2019s (2005) 40 Standard Fire Behavior Fuel Models (Figure 3-2; see\nTable 3-13). The general classification of fuels is by fire-carrying fuel type. Fuels are then further\nclassified into specific fuel models within a fuel type. For example, GS1, GS2, GS3, and GS4 are the fuel\nmodels within the grass\u2013shrub (GS) fuel type. The number identifiers (e.g., the \u201c1\u201d in GS1) describe fuel\ndepth, fuel load, and other characteristics of the fuel type and are used to summarize and predict fire\nbehavior. GR2 and GS2 (grass) fuels are the dominant fuels in the fire behavior analysis area. NB9 fuels\n32\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n(which are classified as bare ground but also account for preexisting solar infrastructure) are also common\n(see Table 3-13; see Figure 3-2).\n3.3.4.3.3 FIRE BEHAVIOR\nWeather, topography, and fuels affect fire behavior. Fire behavior can be described by flame length and\nrate of spread (ROS), among other variables. An extreme weather scenario (97th percentile) was used to\nmodel potential wildfire behavior in the fire behavior analysis area.\n3.3.4.3.3.1 Flame Length\nIn the fire behavior analysis area, flame lengths are expected to predominantly be high (8 to 12 feet),\nreflecting more extreme grass and shrub fire behavior, and low (0 to 4 feet), reflecting large non-burnable\nportions that do not support fire behavior. Also, a large portion of the fire behavior analysis area is\nexpected to have flame lengths greater than 12 feet, which reflects the GR2 and GS2 fuels on steep terrain\nwest of the Project area (Table 3-14, Figure 3-3).\n3.3.4.3.3.2 Rate of Spread\nMost of the fire behavior analysis area would have a ROS greater than 150 chains/hour (1 chain is 66\nfeet) (Table 3-15, Figure 3-4). This faster rate of fire spread is common in flashier fuels, such as the GR2\nand GS2 fuel models, or when there are more continuous fuels. Much of Project area and fire behavior\nanalysis area are classified as non-burnable and have a low ROS (0\u201350 chains/hour), which would not\nsupport fire behavior (see Table 3-15; see Figure 3-4).\n3.3.4.3.4 FIRE MANAGEMENT\nThe Wildland Fire Management Policy (U.S. Department of the Interior 2023) and the National Cohesive\nWildland Fire Management Strategy 2023 update (Forests and Rangelands 2023) provide high-level\ninteragency standards for federal land management agencies in wildfire activities. Currently, the updated\nBLM Southern Nevada District Office Resource Fire Management Plan (BLM 2023b) provides\noverarching guidance and evaluation of wildfire management on public land, including fire and fuels\nmanagement. The Southern Nevada District Office fire program is responsible for fire suppression,\ntreatment of hazardous fuels, fire prevention and investigation, and fire rehabilitation.\nFederal agencies regularly conduct fuels treatments to modify the fire environment to meet different\nmanagement objectives and goals. Common management goals of fuels treatments include modifying\nfuture fire behavior and restoring certain plant species in an ecosystem, among many others. These\ntreatments can include prescribed burning, manual and mechanical treatment methods, aerial and\nmechanical seeding, and chemical application. Management goals determine which fuels treatment\nmethods are prescribed in a specific area (BLM 1998, 2023b).\nFire behavior is an important component of fire management strategies and tactics. In general, fires with\nflame lengths less than 4 feet and ROS less than 20 chains/hour can be effectively controlled with direct\nattack suppression tactics using hand tools or heavy equipment and are therefore considered low-to-\nmoderate fire behavior. However, where flame lengths exceed 4 feet and ROS exceed 20 chains/hour,\nsuppression efforts are typically more difficult and indirect tactics need to be employed. Aviation and\nheavy equipment resources can be critical to fire management depending on fire behavior and location.\nThe suppression difficulty index (SDI) is a measure of the impact to wildfire response resources. The SDI\naccounts for topography, fuels, expected fire behavior under severe fire weather conditions, firefighter\nline production rates in various fuel types, and terrain accessibility (i.e., distance from roads/trails to fire).\nThe SDI categorizes relative suppression by classes from lowest to highest difficulty (U.S. Forest Service\n2022). Most of the fire behavior analysis area indicates a low SDI value (<0.1) under 97th percentile\n33\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nconditions. The western part of the fire behavior analysis area, where there are steeper slopes, displays\nhigher fire suppression indices (Table 3-16).\nThe Southern Nevada District Office of Fire Management provides initial fire response and fire\nmanagement for all wildfires on BLM-administered public lands within the Southern Nevada District\nOffice boundary. The Las Vegas Interagency Communication Center coordinates wildfire response efforts\non BLM-administered lands in the Project area. The capabilities and availability of the BLM to respond to\na potential wildfire would vary due to seasonal staffing levels, availability of and access to appropriate\nequipment, and response times and distances to fire ignitions. The closest BLM fire station is located 24.5\nmiles to the northeast of the Project in Moapa Valley. The Southern Nevada District Office has also\nentered into a cooperative fire protection agreement with the City of North Las Vegas Fire Department\nand the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest that allows for cooperation in fire management. This\ncooperative agreement also allows for the exchange of personnel, equipment, facilities, aircraft, supply\nservices, and funds among the partners. The North Las Vegas Fire Station 57 is situated 15 miles\nsouthwest of the Project area. These relatively far distances for wildfire response resources indicate slow\nresponse times to potential wildfire in or near the Project area. The Southern Nevada District Office also\nhas aerial response resources based in Mesquite and Jean, Nevada, that could respond to fires in or near\nthe Project area. These include single-engine air tankers and an air attack platform. There is also a type 3\nhelicopter and helitack crew (Las Vegas Helitack) based in Las Vegas (BLM 2023b).\nDuring particularly large wildfires, the Southern Nevada District Office can also rely on mutual aid\nagreements with the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Bureau of\nReclamation to provide additional assistance (BLM 2023b). Additionally, all federal partners in Nevada\nand the Nevada Division of Forestry have entered into a Statewide Master Agreement that covers a range\nof fire management and fire suppression actions. During peak wildfire season, the availability of ground\nand aviation assets may be limited due to resources responding to other fires in the state and nationwide;\nsome resources may be bolstered by seasonally staffed positions and stations.\n3.3.4.3.5 FIRE IGNITION RISK\nHuman activities increase potential ignition sources through cigarette butts, other human-ignited\nmaterials, target shooting, sparks or ignitions from vehicles, or sparks from construction, maintenance,\nand decommissioning activities of infrastructure. The small number of human-caused fires surrounding\nthe Project area tend to be in close proximity to roads and population centers (Nevada Division of\nForestry 2023). Data on specific causes are incomplete, but most ignitions have been attributed to\nvehicles, fireworks, and firearms (NIFC 2023).\nThe integrated hazard classifies the likelihood of a given location burning and the intensity of a fire\noccurring in that location; it is a combination of burn probability and conditional flame length. Burn\nprobability is the likelihood of a fire occurring under fixed weather and fuel conditions; it considers fire\nsize in a location, with larger fires producing higher probabilities than smaller fires (Interagency Fuel\nTreatment Decision Support System 2023). Conditional flame length analyzes fire intensity using the\nmean flame length for all fires that burn in a given location. Under 97th percentile weather and current\nfuels conditions, the majority of the fire behavior analysis area is a lower integrated hazard, with\napproximately 100.0% and 99.7% of the Project area and fire behavior analysis area, respectively, being\nconsidered the lower hazard, lowest-lower hazard, or non-burnable (Table 3-17).\n3.3.4.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to fuels and fire risk would occur. The land would remain\navailable for future solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA. Existing\nconditions and trends would continue to affect fuels and fire in the fire behavior analysis area under this\n34\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nalternative. Fuels and fire would continue to be managed consistent with the objectives described in the\nBLM Southern Nevada District Office Resource Fire Management Plan (BLM 2023b) and the Las Vegas\nRMP (BLM 1998).\n3.3.4.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThe Project would result in both direct and indirect impacts to fuels and fire behavior in the Project area.\nVegetation composition and structure, and consequently the correlated fuel model classifications, directly\ninfluence the resulting fire behavior and fire management decisions. Surface-disturbance acres of the\nmajor identified fuel models in the fire behavior analysis area were used to assess the impacts of Project\nconstruction and implementation. The impact to fuel models was calculated based on the total acres of\nfuel models expected to be disturbed by temporary and permanent impacts. These expected disturbances\nwere compared to the acres of each fuel model in the entire analysis area and reported as a percentage\ndisturbed to provide context to the acreage affected. Because changes in fuel models resulting from\ndisturbances in grass communities cannot be predicted with the current and best available data and\nmodeling, only the percentage of affected fuel models is reported; the fire behavior analysis outputs do\nnot incorporate predicted changes in fuel model composition and ratios (Interagency Fuel Treatment\nDecision Support System 2023). Fire behavior modeling results reflect the original fuel models and not\nthe changes due to disturbance.\nProject construction and operations impacts to fuel models would lead to modified fire behavior (ROS\nand flame length), suppression difficulty, and burn probability in the Project area. The effects on the fuels\nand fire risk environment would consist of heightened fire risk due to an increase in sources of ignition,\nalterations in fuels and fire behavior (due to potential noxious and invasive plant propagation), shifts in\nfire regimes, and adjustments to fire management activities.\nProject construction would remove approximately 49.9% of the flammable fuels in the Project area and\nincrease the amount of non-burnable acres in the fire behavior analysis area (Table 3-18), which would\ndecrease the size of the Project area subject to taller flame lengths (Table 3-19) and faster ROS (Table\n3-20). However, removal of these fuels may not lead to a lower fire risk. Currently, most of the fuels in\nthe Project area correspond to the Sonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White Bursage Desert Scrub vegetation\ncommunity (see Section 3.3.9). Vegetative cover in this community is typically low, corresponding to\nlow-to-moderate grass fuel load and non-burnable fuels. The potential conversion of non-burnable fuels to\nareas dominated by flammable fuels (invasive species) could make fire suppression more challenging.\nProject disturbances, including construction, the use of heavy equipment, soil movement and compaction,\ngrading, and road construction and use, could facilitate the introduction and spread of invasive and\nnoxious weeds in the Project area. This would result in altered vegetation structure and composition,\nwhich may change future fire behavior in the Project area and possibly in the fire behavior analysis area.\nChanges to future fire behavior are dependent on vegetation, but an increase in continuity of fine fuels\nand fine fuel loading, if invasive species establish in disturbed sites and then propagate into the analysis\narea, would result in increased fire behavior. Sahara mustard (Brassica tournefortii) and common\nMediterranean grass (Schismus barbatus) are known to currently occur in the Project area (see Section\n3.3.9.5.3). Other invasive species, such as cheatgrass, compact brome, red brome (Bromus rubens), and\nfountaingrass (Pennisetum setaceum) are known to occur in the Las Vegas Field Office (BLM 2023c).\nThe introduction and spread of invasive and noxious weeds would be reduced by the implementation of\nthe Weed Management Plan (see Section 2.2.7), which would also mitigate increased fire risk from\ninvasive and noxious weeds. The Weed Management Plan includes measures such as staff and contractor\ntraining, vehicle and equipment inspections, and weed control. However, invasive grasses (e.g.,\ncheatgrass), even with implementation of a weed management plan, are harder to control with chemical\nand physical methods (Zouhar 2003). Given this, invasive plants, especially grasses, pose the potential to\nalter the existing vegetation communities and fire regimes.\n35\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nAfter Project construction, the remaining grass (GR2) and grass\u2013shrub (GS2) fuels and any\nnonnative/weedy fuels (from Project activities) would be subject to higher ignition hazards due to Project\noperations. Additionally, Project infrastructure could impede and/or prevent initial attack responses\nbecause of its presence and due to increased fire hazards (e.g., the BESS, the presence of electrical\ninfrastructure), which could exacerbate potential fire size. Overall, fire management may experience an\nincrease in the number of incident responses due to additional fire starts.\n3.3.4.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for fuels and fire risk is the same as the fire behavior analysis area\ndescribed in Section 3.3.4.2. Reasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect fuels and\nfire risk in the analysis area include APEX Industrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex\nGenerating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System,\nand the Greenlink West Transmission Project. Cumulatively, these projects could disturb up to 20,329\nacres of land in the fire behavior analysis area (63.4% of the fire behavior analysis area). Development of\nthe Project would cause an additional 1,174.9 acres of disturbance (see Table 2-2), which would be an\nincremental increase of 5.8% to the 20,329-acre total.\nBoth the Project impacts and the potential future projects would variably affect fuels but ultimately\nheighten fire risk. The development of APEX Industrial Park would have a notable impact, leading to\nsubstantial removals of burnable fuels. Similarly, the TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex\nGenerating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System,\nand the Greenlink West Transmission Project would also result in fuel removal. Although these projects\nmight decrease burnable fuels, they would also expand the wildland\u2013urban interface and increase human\npresence in the fire behavior analysis area. These factors could elevate the risk of wildfire ignition and\npotentially lead to the establishment and/or increase the prevalence of noxious and invasive weeds. The\nimplementation of weed management plans could alleviate some of the impacts from invasive and\nnoxious weeds; however, these Project disturbances would still heighten the potential for fire ignition in\nthe analysis area. Additionally, without mitigation of invasive and noxious weed propagation, these\nprojects would increase burn probability in the analysis area.\n3.3.5 Recreation\n3.3.5.1 Introduction\nThe public lands that surround the Project area offer unique and diverse settings and opportunities for\nrecreation, as described in more detail in Section 3.3.5.3.\nProject scoping identified the following recreation issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project change public access and recreation opportunities?\n3.3.5.2 Analysis Area\nThe analysis area for public access and recreation consists of the Project area plus a 5-mile buffer for a\ntotal acreage of approximately 85,687 acres. This analysis area was selected because Project impacts\nresulting from construction, operations, and decommissioning activities have the potential to affect\nrecreational resources both in the Project area and, to some degree, outside the Project area (e.g., access).\nImpacts on recreational use would last until Project termination and reclamation are complete; the Project\nhas a life of approximately 30 years.\n36\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.5.3 Affected Environment\nThis section describes the recreational setting and recreational opportunities in the analysis area, such as\ndesignated recreation sites, recreation access points, designated trails, and dispersed and non-designated\nrecreation activities.\nThe analysis area is in the 2,243,358-acre Southern Nevada Extensive Recreation Management Area\n(ERMA), which includes most public lands managed by the BLM in Southern Nevada east and west of\nLas Vegas (except the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area). The Southern Nevada ERMA is\nmanaged by the BLM for dispersed and diverse recreation opportunities that meet recreation opportunity\nspectrum objectives described in the 1998 Las Vegas RMP (BLM 1998). Recreation opportunities in the\nSouthern Nevada ERMA generally include hiking, camping, hunting, horseback riding, cycling, driving\nfor pleasure, target shooting, off-highway vehicle (OHV) use, and photography. Organized, permitted,\nand competitive uses, such as model airplane and rocketry fly-ins, and competitive OHV events also\noccur in the ERMA. Roads and trails in the Dry Lake Valley area are used for dispersed recreation on a\nlimited basis (BLM 1998). There is also casual OHV use on the dry lakebed north of the Project area. In\naddition, the dry lakebed is used for model airplane flying and for target shooting (BLM and DOE 2010).\nThe Project area is easily accessible, close to Las Vegas, and generally characterized by flat terrain (BLM\n2019a). The Dry Lake Range is in the analysis area and is located to the east of the Project area; I-15\ncrosses the analysis area and is located to the west of the Project area. Access to the Dry Lake Range is\nlimited by a railroad to the east of the Project area that has no vehicle crossings. Recreation data are not\navailable for the analysis area and limited recreational opportunities appear to be present. These\nopportunities would include backcountry driving, OHV use, and recreational shooting. The analysis area\nmay also support some limited camping and hunting opportunities (BLM 2019a). OHV use in the area has\nbeen designated as limited to existing roads, trails, and dry washes (BLM 1998; BLM and DOE 2010).\nRecreational shooting was observed in the Project area during Project survey work. Clark County has an\nordinance that bans the discharge of firearms in unincorporated areas of Clark County within 0.5 mile of a\nhighway or within 500 feet of a public or private road, improved trail, or campground or picnic area\n(Clark County Code of Ordinances 12 (12.04.230)).\n3.3.5.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to recreation would occur. Existing conditions and trends would\ncontinue to affect recreation in the analysis area under this alternative. The land would remain available\nfor future solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.5.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThe main access road into the solar, BESS, and on-site substation area would be permanently fenced off\nand closed to the public during construction and operations. Roads outside the solar, BESS, and on-site\nsubstation area (e.g., the existing paved road off Exit 64 on the south/east side of I-15 and the existing\npaved Las Vegas Boulevard on the north/west side of I-15) would remain open to the public during\nconstruction and operations. However, these roads would be traveled by construction worker vehicles and\nconstruction delivery vehicles. Recreationists using these access roads for backcountry driving, OHV use,\nrecreational shooting, hunting, or camping may experience traffic congestion and slowed speeds during\nconstruction. In addition, the potential noise and activity from construction activities might be audible and\nvisible to nearby recreation users and could detract from the quality of their recreational experience.\nImpacts to recreation-related traffic would be reduced through implementation of a Project-specific\nTraffic Management Plan. The Traffic Management Plan would include traffic stipulations such as\nimplementing traffic control measures to reduce hazards for incoming and outgoing traffic, speed limit\n37\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nreductions, use of informational signs and temporary lane configurations, and incorporating\nenvironmental inspection and monitoring measures to monitor and respond to impacts to recreation\nduring construction, operations, and decommissioning.\nThe solar array/BESS area would be permanently fenced with security fencing and closed to public access\nfor the life of the Project (approximately 30 years) and during reclamation activities. This would result in\na long-term loss of approximately 1,635 acres of public land available for dispersed recreational activities,\nwhich represents approximately 1.9% of the analysis area. It would also prevent access to unofficial dirt\n\u201croads\u201d that may have been previously used by the public for recreation. The loss of public land in this\narea is unlikely to reduce valued recreational opportunities in the analysis area because of the limited\nrecreational opportunities present and the lack of developed recreational facilities (e.g., trails). The quality\nof the recreational experience for visitors on public land near the Project area may be impacted visually;\nhowever, the general area is developed with multiple transmission lines, the Harry Allen Substation, a\nlandfill, a pig farm, industrial use near Garnet, and existing solar development on the west side of the\ninterstate. Visual impacts are discussed in Section 3.3.10.5.\n3.3.5.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for recreation is the same as the analysis area described in Section\n3.3.5.2. Cumulative effects on recreation from the development of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:32) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-104). Reasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect recreation in the\nanalysis area include APEX Industrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex Generating\nStation to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System, Greenlink\nWest Transmission Project, Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, and the Chuckwalla Solar Projects.\nCumulatively, these projects could result in a loss of recreational opportunities on approximately 21,485\nacres of land; however, not all the acreage for these future projects may currently be open for public\nrecreation. Development of the Project would result in the loss of an additional 1,635 acres of public land\nfor recreational uses, which would be a 7.6% incremental increase to the 21,485-acre total.\n3.3.6 Socioeconomics\n3.3.6.1 Introduction\nThis section analyzes the impacts of the No Action Alternative and Proposed Action on the\nsocioeconomic issues identified during scoping. The following issue was identified for detailed analysis\nduring Project scoping:\n\u2022 How would the construction and presence of the proposed Project (including traffic) affect the\nsocioeconomics and rural character of nearby communities?\nEnvironmental justice was dismissed from detailed analysis based on the results of an environmental\njustice baseline report completed for the Project (Appendix F; see Table 3-2).\n3.3.6.2 Analysis Area\nThe analysis area includes key communities of socioeconomic concern with proximity to the Project area\nand the potential to be impacted by the Proposed Action, plus the state of Nevada (with metropolitan\npopulations excluded) as the reference community. Metropolitan populations were excluded from the\nreference community for parity in comparison to the key communities, which are rural (non-metro). Key\ncommunities of socioeconomic concern near the Project area are located approximately 24 miles to the\nnortheast near State Route (SR) 168/169 and I-15. These communities are part of the unincorporated town\n38\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nof Moapa Valley and include Logandale, Moapa Town, Glendale, and Overton. The Moapa Band of\nPaiute Indians, whose members reside on the approximately 72,000-acre Moapa River Indian Reservation\nlocated approximately 6 miles northeast of the Project area, is also included in this analysis.\nImportant landmarks near these communities include Valley of Fire State Park, approximately 20 miles\neast of the Project area; Desert National Wildlife Refuge, approximately 30 miles west of U.S. Route 93\n(U.S. 93) and northwest of the Project area; and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA),\napproximately 40 miles southwest of the Project area. The urban area of Las Vegas is located 20 miles to\nthe southwest. See Figure 1-1 for Project location and adjacent land ownership information.\nSocioeconomic impacts would last until Project termination and reclamation are complete (the Project has\na life of approximately 30 years). Construction and decommissioning would likely have higher traffic\nimpacts than operations because more vehicles would be needed to bring in construction/\ndecommissioning equipment and workers.\n3.3.6.3 Affected Environment\nThe following analysis presents current socioeconomic information for the town of Moapa Valley, the\nMoapa River Indian Reservation, and non-metro Nevada as a reference community comparison.\n3.3.6.3.1 POPULATION\nTable 3-21 displays the 2010 and 2021 populations of the town of Moapa Valley, the Moapa River Indian\nReservation, and non-metro Nevada. Between 2010 and 2021, the Moapa River Indian Reservation\nexperienced a 17.3% decline in population, whereas the population of the town of Moapa Valley\nincreased by almost 20%.\n3.3.6.3.2 AGE PROFILE\nTable 3-22 shows the age information of the residents of the town of Moapa Valley and the Moapa River\nIndian Reservation. The town of Moapa Valley has a higher percentage of individuals under 18 (32.3%)\nthan the Moapa River Indian Reservation (22.4%), whereas the Moapa River Indian Reservation has a\nhigher percentage of individuals between 35 and 44 (20.6%) than the town of Moapa Valley (14.2%).\nAge profile data were not available for non-metro Nevada as a comparison.\n3.3.6.3.3 ETHNIC AND RACIAL PROFILES\nTable 3-23 displays the ethnic and racial profiles of the populations of the town of Moapa Valley, the\nMoapa River Indian Reservation, and non-metro Nevada. Most of the town of Moapa Valley identifies as\nwhite (90.1%), whereas most of the Moapa River Indian Reservation identifies as American Indian\n(76.6%). In comparison, non-metro Nevada identifies as 79.7% white and 3.3% American Indian.\n3.3.6.3.4 TRIBAL POPULATIONS\nTable 3-24 displays the tribal populations in the town of Moapa Valley, the Moapa River Indian\nReservation, and non-metro Nevada. Many residents who identify as part of a tribal population live on the\nMoapa River Indian Reservation (76.6%); in comparison, for the town of Moapa Valley and non-metro\nNevada, 1.2% and 3.3% identify as a member of a tribal community, respectively.\n3.3.6.3.5 JOBS BY INDUSTRY\nTable 3-25 shows total employment in 2021 for residents over 16 years old in the socioeconomic analysis\narea. In the town of Moapa Valley, 36.9% of the working residents are in the management and\nprofessional sector, with 20.7% in the sales and office sector. On the Moapa River Indian Reservation,\n39\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n45.2% of the employed population works in the sales and office sector, with 27.9% in the service sector.\nIn non-metro Nevada, 30.0% of the working population works in the management and professional\nsector, with 19.8% working in the sales and office sector. The percentages mentioned represent the top\ntwo sectors for each of the three socioeconomic communities.\n3.3.6.3.6 UNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nTable 3-26 shows the unemployment rate in the town of Moapa Valley, the Moapa River Indian\nReservation, and non-metro Nevada in 2021. Both the town of Moapa Valley and the Moapa River Indian\nReservation have a higher unemployment rate than non-metro Nevada.\n3.3.6.3.7 HOUSEHOLD INCOME\nTable 3-27 displays the 2021 income levels for the town of Moapa Valley, the Moapa River Indian\nReservation, and non-metro Nevada. The median household income in 2021 for the town of Moapa\nValley was $69,920, whereas the median income for the Moapa River Indian Reservation was $31,429.\nThe median household income data for non-metro Nevada are not available. On the Moapa River Indian\nReservation, 30.0% of households make less than $10,000 per year.\n3.3.6.3.8 POVERTY RATES\nTable 3-28 displays poverty rates in the town of Moapa Valley, the Moapa River Indian Reservation, and\nnon-metro Nevada. The Moapa River Indian Reservation has a higher rate of individual poverty (34.8%)\nand family poverty (29.1%) than the town of Moapa Valley and non-metro Nevada. Table 3-28 also\nshows the number of people in deep poverty. Deep poverty is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as\nearning less than half of the federal poverty level, which is an income that correlates with the number of\npeople in a household. In 2022, the federal poverty level for a family of four was $30,000/year.\n3.3.6.3.9 RURAL CHARACTER AND VALUES\nMoapa Valley is known as a \u201crural, agrarian gem in the southern Nevada desert, made up of several\nscenic communities\u201d (Travel Nevada 2023). It has been inhabited for thousands of years and houses the\nLost City Museum, which tells stories of ancestral Puebloans. Mormon farmers planted roots in the valley\nin the mid to late 1800s; residents are proud of their heritage and community. Recreation is important to\nthe community, with nearby opportunities such as Valley of Fire State Park, Lake Mead, Moapa Valley\nNational Wildlife Refuge, and the Logandale Trails System, which has over 200 miles of recreational\ntrails that are suitable for OHVs but also attract hikers and equestrians.\nThe Moapa Band of Paiutes strives to preserve their legends, songs, and dances despite the cultural\ndisruption of the past 200 years (Moapa Band of Paiutes 2023a). Prior to the 1800s, the Moapa Band of\nPaiutes combined farming with hunting and gathering. They are known for various forms of intricately\ndesigned basketry, including water jars, cradle boards, and cooking baskets. The Tribe had great skill with\nanimal skins and extensive knowledge of the nutritional and medicinal uses of plants (Moapa Band of\nPaiutes 2023a). The Moapa Band of Paiutes is currently governed by a business council that works to\npreserve their homeland and build an independent and self-governing community (Moapa Band of Paiutes\n2023b). The Moapa River Indian Reservation includes solar power generation facilities.\n3.3.6.3.10 TRAFFIC\nRoadways are assigned functional classifications by states according to how the roadway is functioning.\nFunctional classifications assist with roadway design, determining eligibility for federal funding, and\nassessing roadway system performance (U.S. Department of Transportation 2013). The key roadways in\nthe socioeconomic analysis area are I-15, SR 169, U.S. 93, and SR 168. I-15 runs through the southern\n40\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nportion of Nevada from the California state line through Las Vegas to the Utah state line and provides\nprimary access to the Project area. I-15 has a functional classification of interstate; interstates in rural\nareas have average annual daily traffic (AADT) in the approximate range of 12,000 to 34,000 vehicles.\nSR 169, a major collector, runs south from I-15 to the Valley of Fire State Park, north to Moapa Valley,\nand back to I-15. Major collectors in rural areas have AADT in the approximate range of 300 to 2,600\nvehicles. U.S. 93, classified as an other principal arterial, runs north from I-15 between Arrolime and\nDry Lake (south of the Project area) to the Nevada border. Other principal arterials in rural areas have\nAADT in the approximate range of 2,000 to 8,500. SR 168, also a major collector, runs north from I-15\nfrom Glendale through the northeast corner of the Moapa River Indian Reservation to Coyote Springs\n(Nevada Department of Transportation 2023; U.S. Department of Transportation 2013).\n3.3.6.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to socioeconomic conditions would occur. Existing conditions\nand trends would continue to affect socioeconomic issues in the analysis area under this alternative. The\nland would remain available for future solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East\nDLA.\n3.3.6.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\n3.3.6.5.1 POPULATION\nOverall, population in the town of Moapa Valley is increasing faster than that of non-metro Nevada, as\nshown in Table 3-21. Conversely, the Moapa River Indian Reservation experienced a 17.3% population\ndecline between 2010 and 2021. The Project would not contribute to either of these population trends\nbecause construction workers would most likely commute from the Las Vegas area and operations and\nmaintenance staff would typically consist of only two personnel.\n3.3.6.5.2 AGE PROFILE, ETHNIC AND RACIAL PROFILES, TRIBAL\nPOPULATIONS\nFor the same reasons discussed in Section 3.3.6.5.1, the age profile, ethnic and racial profile, and tribal\npopulations in the key communities of socioeconomic concern would not be impacted by the Project.\n3.3.6.5.3 JOBS BY INDUSTRY AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nFor the same reasons discussed in Section 3.3.6.5.1, the jobs held by populations in the socioeconomic\nanalysis area and the unemployment rate in the socioeconomic analysis area would not be impacted by the\nProject.\n3.3.6.5.4 HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND POVERTY RATES\nFor the same reasons discussed in Section 3.3.6.5.1, the household income and poverty rates in the\nsocioeconomic analysis area would not be impacted by the Project.\n3.3.6.5.5 RURAL CHARACTER AND VALUES\nThe development and operations of the proposed Project would alter the landscape, changing the\nundeveloped and rural character of the approximately 1,683.4 acres of the Project area. The proposed\nProject would be visible to community members of the socioeconomic analysis area driving on I-15 and\nU.S. 93, as discussed in Section 3.3.10.5. However, the Project would be sited in an area already\ndeveloped with solar facilities, transmission lines, and industrial buildings and would be an expansion of\nthis type of development in the analysis area.\n41\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nThe Moapa Band of Paiute Indians developed the Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project on their\nreservation, which was the first large-scale solar project to receive construction approval on tribal land in\nNorth America (Center for Innovative Finance Support 2023). Additional solar facilities have since been\nbuilt or are planned on the Moapa River Indian Reservation. The presence of solar development on the\nMoapa River Indian Reservation may indicate that the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians is generally\nsupportive of renewable energy development.\n3.3.6.5.6 TRAFFIC\nThe flow of traffic for Project construction and operations is projected to come from southwest of the\nProject area, on I-15 from Las Vegas. This would include both workers and the delivery of construction\nmaterials and equipment. At the peak of construction, approximately 300 vehicles carrying construction\nworkers would be driving to and from the Project area each day during the typical a.m. and p.m. peak\nhours. In addition, approximately 25 trucks per day are expected to deliver various materials and\nconstruction equipment during peak periods. I-15 has a functional classification of interstate, with an\nAADT in the range of 12,000 to 34,000 vehicles. The addition of 650 daily vehicle trips from the Project\nduring peak construction would be a 5.4% increase to the 12,000 AADT level and a 1.9% increase to the\n34,000 AADT level for I-15. This traffic increase may be noticeable to community members of the\nsocioeconomic analysis area if they are traveling south to Las Vegas; however, traffic increases would be\nshort term and end with the completion of construction.\n3.3.6.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for socioeconomics is the same as the analysis area described in\nSection 3.3.6.2. Cumulative effects from the development of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). Reasonably foreseeable future\nprojects with the potential to affect socioeconomics in the analysis area include APEX Industrial Park,\nwhich would support companies that could create 20,000 jobs and may induce an additional 56,000 jobs in\nthe region; Coyote Springs Investment Development Project, which could add up to 160,000 residential\nunits to a proposed development northwest of the Project area; Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, which\nwould create revenue for tribal members and jobs for tribal members and Clark County residents (BIA\n2021); Chuckwalla Solar Projects, which would create revenue for tribal members and jobs for tribal\nmembers and Clark County residents (BIA 2022a); Yahthumb Solar Project, which would also create\nrevenue for tribal members and jobs for tribal members and Clark County residents (BIA 2022b); and\nseveral transmission line projects (see Table 3-1) (ImpactNV: Nevada\u2019s Sustainability Alliance 2023;\nSeagall 2022). These projects could impact the socioeconomic analysis area by increasing employment\nopportunities, increasing tribal revenue, providing additional housing, and potentially increasing the\npopulation and demands on services and utilities. The rural character and values of the analysis area could\nbe impacted by increasing traffic from these projects and by the presence of these projects on the\nlandscape, which would continue a trend of existing development that includes multiple transmission lines,\nthe Harry Allen Substation, a landfill, a pig farm, industrial use near Garnet, and solar development. The\nProject would primarily contribute incrementally to the trend of increasing development on the landscape.\n3.3.7 Soils\n3.3.7.1 Introduction\nThis section identifies the soil resources in and near the proposed Project that would be affected by\nProject construction, operations, and decommissioning. Project scoping identified the following soil\nresource issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project affect soils and soil erosion?\n42\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.7.2 Analysis Area\nThe geographic analysis area for soils consists of the subwatershed containing the Project area:\nhydrologic unit code (HUC) 10 Dry Lake Valley (approximately 154,114 acres in size). This analysis area\nprovides context for potential soil impacts by comparing the soil types impacted in the Project area to the\ntotal acreage of those soil types in the subwatershed. It also provides a distinct, natural topographic\nboundary in which to analyze potential impacts to soils. The temporal analysis area consists of the life of\nthe Project (approximately 30 years), plus reclamation. Temporal scales for reclamation vary depending\non soil impacts but could take decades to centuries.\n3.3.7.3 Affected Environment\n3.3.7.3.1 SOIL TYPES\nThere are 29 soil types (Soil Survey Geographical Database Map Units) in the soils analysis area\n(National Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2023). Five of these soil types are in the Project area\n(Table 3-29). According to the NRCS (2015a), \u201cthe Colorock soils are on smooth to gently convex, gently\nto moderately sloping broad alluvial fans at elevations of 1,300 to 3,000 feet. Slope gradients are\ncommonly 2 to 5 percent but range up to 8 percent. The alluvial fans are dissected by a few shallow, and\nwidely spread very deep intermittent stream channels.\u201d The Colorock series formed in gravelly alluvium\nfrom mixed rock sources, dominantly from limestone with some quartzite and sandstone. These soils are\nwell drained with medium runoff and moderate permeability to the indurated hardpan (NRCS 2015a).\nThe Tonopah soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. Bard soils are on valley fill terraces, alluvial\nfans, and fan remnants. These soils formed in mixed or loamy alluvium. Slopes for both soils range from\n0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,500 to 3,400 feet above mean sea level for Tonopah soils and\n1,600 to 3,000 feet above mean sea level for Bard soils. Tonopah soils are excessively to well drained\nwith very low to medium runoff and moderately rapid permeability; available water to a depth of 60\ninches (or restricted depth) is very low and shrink-swell potential is low. Bard soils are well drained with\nslow or medium runoff and moderate permeability; shrink-swell potential is low and available water to a\ndepth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very low. The NRCS lists the Bard-Tonopah association as\n\u201chighly fragile\u201d based on its poor structure, low organic matter, dryness, and moderate vegetative cover.\nFragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation (BLM 2019a; NRCS 2015b, 2023).\nSlopes are 15 to 50 percent for the Rockland\u2013St. Thomas association, which is very steep. The parent\nmaterial is colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite over residuum weathered from limestone and\ndolomite. These soils are well drained. Water movement in the most restrictive layer is very low.\nAvailable water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is very low and shrink-swell potential is low\n(BLM 2019a).\nAdditional information on these soil types can be found in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a).\nMost of these soils have a high surface runoff potential and moderate permeability. Water erosion potential\nranges from low to high; most of the DLA (and therefore the Project area) (90%) is covered by soils that\nare moderately susceptible to water erosion. In addition, most of the DLA soils are moderately susceptible\nto wind erosion, with as much as 86 tons of soil eroded by wind per acre each year (BLM 2019a).\n3.3.7.3.2 BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS AND DESERT PAVEMENT\nBiological soil crusts are matrices of soil particles on the surface of the soil that comprise cyanobacteria,\nmosses, lichens, and bacteria (Williams et al. 2013). Desert pavement is a soil feature that refers to the\ninterlocking rock fragments on the surface of the soil with sparse plant cover (Williams et al. 2013).\nDesert pavement and biological soil crusts were identified on every soil type in the Project area during\n43\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nbotanical resource surveys (SWCA Environmental Consultants [SWCA] 2023a). Table 3-30 summarizes\nthe estimated amount of biological soil crust and desert pavement observed during surveys.\n3.3.7.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants, the Project would not be\nconstructed, and existing land uses in the Project area would continue. No Project-specific impacts to\nsoils would occur. The BLM would continue to manage the land consistent with the 1998 Las Vegas\nRMP (BLM 1998). The land would remain available for future solar energy projects because of its\nlocation in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.7.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nGround disturbance associated with the construction, operations, and decommissioning of the Project\nwould have both short- and long-term impacts to soils in the Project area. The Proposed Action has the\npotential to temporarily and permanently impact 1,174.9 acres through ground-disturbing activities\nincluding grading and leveling, overland travel, road construction and maintenance, and vegetation\nmowing and/or removal (see Table 2-2). Areas of the Project that would experience temporary\ndisturbance would likely have permanent impacts to soils from the activities listed above. Areas of D-1\nsoil disturbance (335.6 acres; see Table 2-2) would have the least impacts to soils, although overland\ntravel can still result in soil compaction and reduced soil functioning. Most of the temporary disturbance\nfor the Project would consist of D-2 soil disturbance (529.2 acres; see Table 2-2), which can result in\nstrong soil compaction, loss of soil carbon due to vegetation removal, reduced soil functioning, and\nincreased erosion. There also would be 15.4 acres of temporary D-3 soil disturbance and 294.7 acres of\npermanent D-3 soil disturbance (see Table 2-2), which would result in complete soil restructuring, soil\ncompaction, and soil loss through removal and increased erosion. Most disturbance would occur in the\nBard gravelly fine sandy loam soil type, which covers 86.9% of the Project area.\nSoil compaction from the construction and operation of solar farms can be severe and long term. Soil\ncompaction has been shown to be an obstacle for reclamation and revegetation efforts, with even \u201clight\u201d\ndisturbance, such as from repeated foot traffic, able to sufficiently compact or destroy natural soil\nstructure and impact plant growth, nutrient cycling, and water infiltration (Brevik et al. 2002; Lovich and\nBainbridge 1999). Natural recovery from soil compaction may require 92 to 124 years (Webb et al. 1986)\nand would likely be slowest for areas under high, repeated disturbance such as grading.\nRemoving or mixing topsoil, as is often associated with grading, leveling, and tilling, results in losses of\nnative seedbanks, soil nutrients, organic matter, and microbial communities that are necessary for\nsupporting healthy vegetation communities (Abella 2010; Lovich and Bainbridge 1999). Soil erosion\nassociated with loss of vegetative cover can also cause loss of these soil resources. These losses would\ndelay reestablishment of native plant communities after construction and decommissioning of the Project.\nHowever, topsoil salvage would be performed in temporary use D-3 soil disturbance areas (see Table\n2-2). After construction, salvaged topsoil would be replaced and reseeded which would assist with the\nreestablishment of native plant communities.\nSoil disturbance is also an important factor in the spread and establishment of invasive plants, with plant\ninvasion shown to be higher in areas with greater levels of soil disturbance (Gelbard and Belnap 2003;\nOrb\u00e1n et al. 2021). Implementation of the Weed Management Plan would reduce the spread and\nestablishment of invasive and noxious weeds after Project disturbance.\nSensitive soil features, including biological soil crusts and desert pavements, are soil types that are most\nvulnerable to disturbance impacts. The Project is anticipated to impact up to approximately 10.5 acres of\nknown biological soil crust and 74.5 acres of known desert pavement (see Table 3-30). Additionally, the\n44\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nNRCS lists the Bard-Tonopah association as having highly fragile soils that are susceptible to\ndegradation, which comprises another 14.1 acres in the Project area. The magnitude of disturbance to\nsensitive soils depends on the construction methods used; grading and leveling would completely remove\nall biological soil crusts and desert pavements and cause the greatest disturbance and loss of these\nresources. Overland travel would cause less soil disruption. Soils exposed by removal or disturbance of\nsoil crusts or desert pavements would be subject to accelerated erosion by wind and water.\nFollowing construction, areas of temporary disturbance (approximately 880.2 acres) (see Table 2-2)\nwould be revegetated. Revegetation in desert environments is often met with limited success (Walker and\nPowell 1999); post-disturbance revegetation is likely to have lower vegetative cover and higher invasive\nspecies presence than pre-disturbance cover. Increases in invasive species cover would likely result in an\nincrease in the frequency and intensity of herbicide treatments, which can be damaging to biological soils\nand reduce soil functioning (Von Reis 2015). Shading of soils from solar panels has been shown to alter\nbiotic soil components as well as increase soil nutrient concentrations, which can alter soil functioning\n(Smith et al. 1987). However, the operations and maintenance of aboveground structures would likely\nhave minimal additional impact to soil resources.\nDecommissioning would likely have a disturbance area similar to that disturbed during construction.\nThere would be permanent soil function loss where soils were completely covered by Project structures or\nremoved. The timeline for successful restoration would be influenced by the level of disturbance over the\nlife of the Project; disturbance in some areas may be irreversible (Aronson et al. 1993).\n3.3.7.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for soils is the same as the analysis area described in Section 3.3.7.2.\nCumulative effects on soils from Project development would be similar to those described in the Dry\nLake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:36) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). Soil\nimpacts associated with Project activities and reasonably foreseeable future projects would be associated\nwith long-term loss of productivity. Reasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect\nsoils in in the analysis area include APEX Industrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex\nGenerating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System,\nGreenlink West Transmission Project, Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, and Chuckwalla Solar Projects.\nCumulatively, these projects could result in up to 21,485 acres of permanent soil disturbance.\nDevelopment of the Project would cause an additional 1,174.9 acres of soil disturbance (see Table 2-2),\nwhich would be an incremental increase of 5.5% to the 21,485-acre total. This disturbance could have\nsimilar impacts to soil resources as those described in Section 3.3.7.5, including compaction, soil loss,\naltered nutrient cycling, and overall loss of soil function. Soil compaction would decrease water\ninfiltration and runoff, potentially leading to a redistribution of soil moisture and vegetation productivity\nresponse in the analysis area. Additionally, because biological soils require tens to thousands of years to\nrecover after disturbance, any disturbances that remove biotic soils are considered permanent (Belnap and\nLange 2003; Williams et al. 2013).\n3.3.8 Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Animal Species\n3.3.8.1 Introduction\nThe Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), establishes protections for fish, wildlife, and\nplants that are listed as threatened, endangered, or a candidate for listing. An endangered species is any\nspecies that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a substantial portion of its range. A threatened\nspecies is any species that is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout\nall or a substantial portion of its range. Threatened and endangered species are placed on a federal list by\nthe USFWS and receive protection under the ESA, as amended. Candidate species are species for which\n45\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nthe USFWS has sufficient information on their biological status and threats to propose them as\nendangered or threatened under the ESA, but for which development of a proposed listing regulation is\nprecluded by other higher priority listing activities. Species identified for this analysis were derived from\nan online review of the USFWS Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) support tool for Clark\nCounty (USFWS 2023). One threatened, endangered, or candidate animal species is likely to occur in the\nProject area.\nProject scoping identified the following threatened, endangered, or candidate animal species issue for\ndetailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project affect the desert tortoise and its habitat?\n3.3.8.2 Analysis Area\nThe analysis area for the desert tortoise consists of the approximately 5,044,266-acre desert tortoise\nNortheastern Recovery Unit, which contains the Project area and recipient site (tortoise translocation is\ndescribed in Section 3.3.12). This analysis area is intended to capture existing conditions and potential\nProject and cumulative impacts to individuals and habitats and is based on biological surveys for desert\ntortoises (SWCA 2023b; USFWS 2011). Desert tortoise habitat impacts would be considered permanent;\nhowever, individual tortoises impacted by the Project would be translocated to new habitats.\n3.3.8.3 Affected Environment\nAccording to the IPaC support tool (USFWS 2023), five federally threatened and endangered species\nhave potential to occur in the vicinity of the Project area: the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher\n(Empidonax traillii extimus), the threatened yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), the threatened\ndesert tortoise, the endangered Moapa dace (Moapa coriacea), and the candidate monarch butterfly\n(Danaus plexippus). The desert tortoise is the only ESA-listed species likely to occur in the Project area\n(USFWS 2023) and is discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.8.3.1. The desert tortoise is also protected\nfrom \u201ctake\u201d under Nevada state law.\nThe southwestern willow flycatcher, yellow-billed cuckoo, and Moapa dace are riparian species that\nrequire surface water. Moapa dace are restricted to clear pools and outlet streams of moderate to high\ntemperatures (NatureServe 2023). The nearest population of Moapa dace occurs in the headwater\ntributaries of the Muddy River, approximately 26 miles northeast of the Project area. The Project area is\nnot located within or near riparian habitat, and it is not within a known corridor that would connect any\naquatic features.\nMonarch butterfly breeding habitat generally contains native milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae) or dogbane\n(Apocynaceae), which serve as host plants for larvae. Monarch butterflies seek areas with nectar\nproducing plants for use as migratory and/or stopover habitat. Overwintering habitat generally consists of\na grove of trees that provides protection from low temperatures and wind (Western Association of Fish\nand Wildlife Agencies 2019). Occurrence records are scattered throughout Nevada and vary based on\nseason and elevation. This species migrates through the southern part of the state to overwintering sites in\nCalifornia. Given that the Project area contains no suitable host plants or tree groves, and few nectar\nproducing plants preferred by this species, it does not provide suitable breeding, stopover, or\noverwintering habitat for monarch butterfly, although this species may migrate through the analysis area.\n3.3.8.3.1 MOJAVE DESERT TORTOISE\nIn the Mojave Desert, the desert tortoise occurs primarily in areas with sandy loam soils, gently sloping\nterrain, and a sparse cover of low-growing shrubs below 5,500 feet above mean sea level (USFWS 2011).\nThe range of the Mojave population of desert tortoises includes portions of northwestern Arizona,\n46\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nsouthwestern Utah, southern Nevada, and southern California. The Project area is located in the\nNortheastern Mojave Recovery Unit as revised in the most recent desert tortoise recovery plan (USFWS\n2011) (Figure 3-5), though it is not located within any critical habitat units or areas of critical\nenvironmental concern (ACECs) designated for desert tortoise. The nearest critical habitat unit (Mormon\nMesa) and ACEC (Coyote Springs) are both located approximately 2.3 miles northwest of the gen-tie line.\nDesert tortoises are known to occur in the Project area and analysis area (SWCA 2023b). Suitable habitat\nfor the desert tortoise occurs in the Project area and is modeled as high value (0.8\u20130.9) habitat (Nussear et\nal. 2009). These data are consistent with the information for threatened and endangered species presented\nin the affected environment section of the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-40\u201311.3-\n42) and the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:50\u201351). The Western Solar Plan PEIS identifies the\nProject area as \u201cPriority 1\u201d tortoise connectivity habitat based on a least-cost pathway model. Areas\ndesignated as Priority 1 provide desert tortoise populations with optimal habitat linkages between pairs of\nconservation areas (Argonne National Laboratory 2012). In addition, the Project area is located within two\nleast-cost corridors (Averill-Murray et al. 2013) for the desert tortoise (Mormon Mesa to Lake Mead NRA\nand Desert National Wildlife Refuge to Lake Mead NRA), which provide habitat linkages for sustaining\nhealthy tortoise populations (see Figure 3-5).\nSurvey data indicate that the DLA is high- to moderate-density tortoise habitat. In fall 2022, a portion of\nthe analysis area (solar/BESS site boundary) was surveyed (SWCA 2023b) in accordance with USFWS\ndesert tortoise survey protocol (USFWS 2019). There were 14 tortoises encountered during the surveys, 13\nof which met the USFWS criteria (adult tortoises greater than 180 millimeters [mm]) to be included in a\npopulation estimate (SWCA 2023b). Tortoises were observed throughout the solar/BESS portion of the\nProject area. Tortoise density was estimated at 4.3 adult tortoises per square kilometer (km2). The\nestimated number of adult tortoises within the surveyed area is 29, as well as an estimated 149 subadult\nand juvenile tortoises (Table 3-31). Tortoise surveys were also performed in an approximately 916-acre\nsurvey area centered on the proposed gen-tie line (SWCA 2023b). Biologists surveyed 16.8 miles during\nsurveys of the gen-tie line area. No desert tortoises were encountered on transects or opportunistically in\nthe gen-tie line area. The BLM has identified the 13,160-acre Dry Lake Translocation Area (Ironwood\n2015) (see Figure 3-5) as the proposed recipient site for tortoises found in the Project area.\n3.3.8.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to desert tortoises would occur. Existing conditions and trends\nwould continue to affect desert tortoises in the analysis area under this alternative. The land would remain\navailable for future solar energy projects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.8.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nImpacts to desert tortoises from Project construction and operations would be similar to those described in\nthe Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:50\u201351) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-35\u201311.3-40). The type of impacts from the Project to desert tortoises and suitable habitat\ninclude direct mortality; habitat loss, modification, and fragmentation; increased noise; and increased\nhuman activity. The Proposed Action would permanently disturb 294.7 acres and temporarily disturb\n880.2 acres of desert tortoise habitat (see Table 2-2), all of which is considered priority connectivity\nhabitat. The 1,174.9 acres of total disturbance would be considered a permanent loss of habitat in the\nProject area; this is equivalent to a loss of \u22641% of desert tortoise habitat in the analysis area. Construction\nactivities may increase mortality risk for individual tortoises, which could result from being crushed by\nvehicles or equipment. Trash and litter can attract opportunistic predators such as coyotes and ravens\nwhich may lead to increased tortoise predation (Berry 1985; Esque et al. 2010). These impacts would be\nminimized by the application of design features and stipulations and the implementation of the Fencing\n47\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nPlan and Translocation Plan. Protective actions in these plans would include performing clearance\nsurveys, installation of tortoise-proof fencing, and having tortoise monitors present during activities that\nmay injure or kill a tortoise. Opportunistic predation would be addressed through a worker education and\nawareness program consistent with the Common Raven Management Plan for Energy Development within\nthe BLM Southern Nevada District (BLM 2018) and the Project\u2019s Raven Management Plan (Appendix B2\nof the Project PODs). The Raven Management Plan includes measures such as proper trash removal and\nstorage and removing inactive raven nests. Indirect effects from noise and vibration associated with\nconstruction activities could cause some tortoises to abandon their burrows and seek other existing cover\nsites. This would temporarily expose them to an increased risk of predation as they seek other burrows\nwithin their home range.\nThe Proposed Action could result in adverse impacts to local or regional genetic connectivity of the\ntortoise population. Solar energy development may isolate and fragment tortoise populations by creating\nimpediments to natural migration patterns (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-51\u201311.3.52). The Project area is\nlocated within a Priority 1 desert tortoise connectivity area, defined as a least-cost linkage between\nconservation areas that represents a priority area for conservation of tortoise population connectivity\n(Argonne National Laboratory 2012). The loss of priority connectivity habitat from solar energy\ndevelopment is addressed through required design features in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and\nDOE 2012:11.3-58\u201311.3.59) and reduction of the overall size of the Dry Lake SEZ. Remaining impacts\nwere addressed through development of the Regional Mitigation Strategy for the Dry Lake Solar Energy\nZone (BLM 2014b). In addition, a Regional Mitigation Strategy has been developed for the Project (see\nAppendix B). Tortoise habitat fragmentation effects would be further minimized by application of a\nfencing mitigation measure (Section 3.3.8.7). Under this measure, clearance surveys would be performed\non an additional 342.4 acres to avoid isolating any tortoises. Tortoises would be captured and translocated\nto the release area (see Figure 3-5), which is larger, thereby increasing habitat and forage availability for\nthis population. Potential residual effects of implementing this measure would include permanent removal\nof tortoises from the 342.4-acre area and increased tortoise density within the release area. Mitigation\nwould also include having smaller rip rap throughout the site, so that juvenile desert tortoises not located\nduring initial clearances are not trapped in rip rap. Residual effects include the other described potential\nrisks to juvenile desert tortoises within the Project area.\nTranslocation of tortoises would directly impact the release area by increasing local population density\nand consumption of resources. The Proposed Action would also directly impact any tortoise home ranges\nthat overlap with the Project area by removing all or part of the former territory and decreasing the overall\nquality of habitat in and around the Project area. The capture, transport, and release of individual tortoises\nduring translocation would result in harassment. Translocated tortoises are at an increased risk of\nmortality if they void their bladders or are exposed to temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (Averill-\nMurray 2002; USFWS 2009). Translocated populations may encounter increased intraspecific\ninteractions, an increased incidence of aggressive interactions between individuals, and an increased\nincidence of predation.\nDesert tortoise translocation would be completed in accordance with a site-specific USFWS-approved\nTranslocation Plan. Through consultation with the USFWS, the Applicant would identify density\nthresholds for tortoise populations in the release area and procedures for pre-disturbance clearance\nsurveys and tortoise handling, as well as disease testing and post-translocation monitoring and reporting\nrequirements in accordance with the Translocation Plan and design features and stipulations (see\nAppendix E). Release area densities would remain within acceptable levels as defined by translocation\nguidance, thus minimizing density-dependent effects on resident populations. Only tortoises determined\nto be healthy and asymptomatic would be translocated to minimize the risk of disease transmission.\n48\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.8.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for desert tortoise is the same as the analysis area described in\nSection 3.3.8.2. Cumulative impacts to desert tortoise from the Project would be consistent with those\ndescribed in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:52) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-104). The Proposed Action, in conjunction with other projects, would result in cumulative\nimpacts to desert tortoises, including habitat loss and modification. Reasonably foreseeable future projects\nwith the potential to affect desert tortoises in the analysis area consist of the 13 projects listed in Table\n3-1. Cumulatively, these projects could result in up to 66,394 acres of permanent disturbance to desert\ntortoise habitat. Development of the Project would cause an additional 1,174.9 acres of permanent habitat\ndisturbance (see Table 2-2), which would be an incremental increase of 1.8% to the 66,394-acre total.\nDesert tortoises found in the Project area would be translocated to the Dry Lake Translocation Area,\nwhich was designated in the Dry Lake SEZ Translocation Plan as the release area for tortoises within the\nSEZ and contains tortoises translocated from the Dry Lake Solar Project (Ironwood 2015). Translocation\nof tortoises found in the Project area would follow the Translocation Plan, which would be developed in\ncoordination with the BLM and the USGS. Translocation of tortoises from the Project area to the release\narea would impact the resident tortoise population by increasing tortoise density and decreasing available\nresources; however, tortoise density following translocation would still be within the acceptable level for\na translocation site in the Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit (USFWS 2011). Cumulative impacts\nwould be addressed through implementation of the Regional Mitigation Strategy for the Project (see\nAppendix B).\n3.3.8.7 Mitigation Measures\n\u2022 Gravel (rip rap) where desert tortoises may be present must be small enough that a juvenile desert\ntortoise can move through it without becoming stuck.\n\u2022 Additional compensatory mitigation for desert tortoises would be developed in consultation with\nthe USFWS through Section 7.\nThe following mitigation measure is known as the fencing mitigation measure:\nThe Project is bounded on the east side by an active railroad, on the west side by I-15, and on the south\nside by a Republic Services security and desert tortoise fence (Figure 3-6). Because of the highly\nfragmented and already impacted nature of the area, reintroduction of desert tortoise to the Project area\nafter construction was not considered. Therefore, desert tortoises would be cleared and excluded from the\nProject area for the life of the Project.\nAs shown in Figure 3-6, the area south of the Republic Services fence has previously been cleared of\ndesert tortoises. In accordance with this mitigation measure, the desert tortoise clearance area would\ninclude the entirety of the area north of the Republic Services fence, west to the I-15 desert tortoise fence,\neast to the railroad, and north to the northern Project boundary (see Figure 3-6). This clearance area\nincludes the approximately 1,348 acres of clearance proposed by the Applicant, as well as an additional\n342.4 acres, for a total tortoise clearance area of approximately 1,690.4 acres. The additional clearance\narea is required to avoid isolating any tortoises that may still be using habitat within this area. Informal\nconsultation between the BLM and USFWS has resulted in a determination that relocating the tortoises\nwithin this highly modified landscape presents the best long-term outcome for desert tortoises in the area.\nThe northern Project boundary would consist of a security fence co-located with a desert tortoise\nexclusion fence, which would transition off the Project boundary to only a desert tortoise exclusion fence.\nAt the intersection with the railroad ROW, the tortoise exclusion fence would incorporate the USFWS\u2019s\nupdated design for a turn-around to direct pacing tortoises back into existing habitat (Figure 3-7).\n49\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nBecause the rest of the site would have desert tortoise clearance, and the BLM and USFWS agree that the\nnumber of tortoises successfully using the railroad underpasses along the east side of the Project area is\nlikely to be extremely low, desert tortoise fencing would not be required in any other portions of the\nProject (see Figure 3-6).\nAround panel array blocks, with the exception shown in Figure 3-6, security fencing would be lifted 8\ninches off the ground to allow other types of wildlife ingress and egress along site boundaries.\n\u2022 Security fencing (panel array block subareas): To allow for wildlife ingress and egress, the\nsecurity fence around each subarea would be installed 8 inches off the ground around each\nsubarea, as described in the POD. The security fence would be installed from the inside of the\nfence, with all spoils from any trenching pushed to the inside of the fence (to concentrate\ndisturbance on only one side of the fence). There is one exception to this, shown in Figure 3-6,\nwhere security fencing would be installed to the ground because it is directly adjacent to an\naccess route.\n\u2022 Security fencing (BESS, substations, laydown area): Security fencing would be installed to the\nground. Desert tortoise fencing is not required because tortoises would be cleared from the area.\n\u2022 Northern Project boundary fence: Along the northern boundary of the Project area, desert tortoise\nfencing would be installed in line with the security fence and from the security fence to the ROW\nboundary with the railroad. At the intersection of the ROW boundary with the railroad, the\ntortoise fence would be curved out away from the Project to redirect tortoises back into the area\nnorth of the Project (see Figure 3-7). Three fence segments would form the turn-around, with the\nfirst and second segments having 110\u00b0 angles, and the third segment having a 140\u00b0 angle. Each\nfence segment used in the turn-around would be 5 feet long.\n\u2022 Tortoise guards: Tortoise guards would not be required for this Project, as tortoises would be\ncleared from all Project areas south of the northern perimeter fence.\n\u2022 Wildlife openings: These would be installed along the northern boundary of the Project area,\nwithin the desert tortoise exclusionary fence but aboveground, to allow ingress/egress of other\nwildlife species.\no Wildlife access holes (12 inches tall by 12 inches wide) would be installed within the\npermanent outer perimeter security and tortoise fencing (fence sections that are not shared\nwith or bordering those of adjacent solar facilities).\no The bottom of the access holes would be set at 5 inches from the ground to facilitate access\ninto and out of the facility for general species and would be installed within the bottom-half\ncenter of a 10 \u00d7 4\u2013foot screen or tarp secured to the fence in order to increase visual\nrecognition for wildlife.\no Wildlife access holes would be installed at an interval of every 0.15 mile (approximately 250\nmeters) along perimeter fences that are not lifted 8 inches off the ground. If fencing is lifted 8\ninches, wildlife access holes are not required.\no Wildlife access holes would be installed during or immediately following establishment of\nthe perimeter security fence to allow general wildlife species egress and to limit potential\nmortality from enclosure and subsequent construction activities.\no The BLM may install camera traps to monitor species diversity and volume of use at all or a\nsubset of wildlife openings.\n50\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.9 Vegetation, Special-Status Plant Species, and Noxious Weeds\n3.3.9.1 Introduction\nThis section includes an evaluation of vegetation (including cacti and yucca), special-status plant species,\nand noxious weeds and invasive species. Project scoping identified the following issue for detailed\nanalysis:\n\u2022 How would ground disturbance from the proposed Project impact general vegetation, special-\nstatus plant species, cacti and yucca, and noxious weeds and invasive species?\n3.3.9.2 Analysis Area\nThe geographic analysis area for vegetation and special-status plant species consists of the HUC 10\nsubwatershed that contains the Project area: Dry Lake Valley (approximately 154,114 acres in size). This\nanalysis area provides context for potential impacts because it is a distinct, natural topographic boundary\nin which to analyze potential impacts to vegetation. The temporal analysis area is the life of the Project\n(30 years) plus reclamation and was chosen because impacts to vegetation would last until Project\nreclamation is complete. Temporal scales for reclamation vary depending on initial impacts to the\nvegetation. Vegetated areas impacted by overland travel disturbance would be anticipated to recover in 2\nyears post-reclamation. Vegetated areas impacted by clear and cut or overland disturbance would be\nanticipated to recover 5 to 10 years post-reclamation. Vegetated areas impacted by clear and cut with soil\nremoval disturbance would be anticipated to recover 50 to 200 years post-reclamation.\n3.3.9.3 Affected Environment\n3.3.9.3.1 GENERAL VEGETATION\nVegetation cover types described and mapped under the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project\n(SWReGAP) (USGS 2005a) were used to evaluate plant communities in the Project area. Land cover\ntypes occurring in the Project area are shown in Figure 3-8. Table 3-32 lists the surface area of each cover\ntype in the Project area.\nThe Sonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White Bursage Desert Scrub (creosote bush) vegetation community\ncovers approximately 96.2% of the Project area. North American Warm Desert Wash covers\napproximately 3.6% of the Project area, with the remaining land cover types each comprising less than\n1% of the Project area. General descriptions of the two largest SWReGAP vegetation communities in the\nProject area and their associated flora are provided below.\nSonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White Bursage Desert Scrub: This vegetation community occurs in\nbroad valleys, lower bajadas, plains, and low hills in the Mojave Desert and lower Sonoran Desert. This\nsystem ranges from a sparse to moderately dense layer (2%\u201350% cover). Creosote bush and white\nbursage (Ambrosia dumosa) are the typical dominant species, but a variety of shrub, dwarf-shrub, and\ncacti may be present to co-dominant. Additional species may include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex\ncanescens), desert holly (Atriplex hymenelytra), brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), ephedra (Ephedra spp.),\nocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), wolfberry (Lycium andersonii), and beavertail pricklypear (Opuntia\nbasilaris). Herbaceous species are sparse but may be seasonally abundant with annual species such as\nsandmat (Chamaesyce spp.), desert trumpet (Eriogonum inflatum), wooly fluffgrass (Dasyochloa\npulchella), forget-me-not (Cryptantha sp.), and scorpion weed (Phacelia sp.) (USGS 2005a).\nNorth American Warm Desert Wash: This land cover refers to intermittently flooded linear or braided\nwashes within desertscrub or desert grassland\u2013dominated landscapes. These washes are predominantly\ndry but experience sporadic fluvial processes that strongly influence this system. The vegetation\n51\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\ncomposition and community can vary widely from sparse to moderately dense and primarily grows along\nthe bank or within the wash channel itself. Woody vegetation is usually sparse and often includes species\nsuch as catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), splitleaf brickellbush (Brickellia laciniata), desert broom\n(Baccharis sarothroides), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa),\ncheesebush (Ambrosia salsola), singlewhorl burrobrush (Hymenoclea monogyra), mesquite (Prosopis\nspp.), smoke tree (Psorothamnus spinosus), desert almond (Prunus fasciculata), littleleaf sumac (Rhus\nmicrophylla), Mexican bladdersage (Salazaria mexicana), and greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus)\n(USGS 2005a).\n3.3.9.3.2 SPECIAL-STATUS PLANTS\nSpecial-status plant species include those that are designated as threatened, endangered, or candidates for\nlisting under the ESA; species listed as sensitive by the BLM; and species listed as rare, threatened, or\nendangered by the State of Nevada. The USFWS\u2019s IPaC online database (USFWS 2023) did not identify\nany federally threatened, endangered, or candidate plant species or any critical habitats for special-status\nplant species.\nNo Nevada State special-status species were identified through agency data searches. A Nevada Division\nof Natural Heritage (NDNH) data search identified two BLM special-status plant species within 0.5 mile\nof the Project area: rosy two-tone beardtongue (Penstemon bicolor var. roseus) and threecorner milkvetch\n(Astragalus geyeri var. triquetrus) (NDNH 2022). The Project area has potential habitat for rosy two-tone\nbeardtongue but it was determined through consultation with the BLM that it lacked the sandy soils\nrequired by threecorner milkvetch (Kobelt 2022).\nProtocol-level surveys for special-status plants were conducted in the Project area from November 8 to\n12, 2022, and November 29 to December 7, 2022. No special-status plants were observed within the\nProject area. While conducting windshield surveys for invasive and noxious weeds, four Penstemon\nspecies were observed incidentally along the access road to the Harry Allen Substation. These Penstemon\nspecies were unidentifiable at the time of survey but were revisited on April 28, 2023, and were\ndetermined to be dead. No other Penstemon species were observed (SWCA 2023a).\nThe Project area lacked washes with sandy-gravel soils. Nearly all washes in the Project area had high\nclay content and limited water intrusion into the soil. Given this, no potential habitat for rosy two-tone\nbeardtongue exists within the Project area.\n3.3.9.3.3 CACTI AND YUCCA\nThe most prevalent cactus species that occurred in the Project area were beavertail pricklypear, with 159\nindividuals and 1.9 plants per acre; Wiggins\u2019 cholla (Cylindropuntia echinocarpa), with 34 individuals\nand 0.4 plants per acre; cottontop cactus (Echinocactus polycephalus), with 36 individuals and 0.3 plants\nper acre; and buckhorn cholla (Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa), with 37 individuals and 0.2 plants per acre.\nAll 55 observed Mojave yucca (Yucca schidigera) individuals occurred in the Colorock association\n(Table 3-33) (SWCA 2023a).\nTable 3-34 shows the density of each cactus and yucca species per acre. Table 3-35 shows the estimated\ndensity of cacti and yucca within each soil map unit in the survey area, as extrapolated from the results of\nthe plot sampling.\n3.3.9.3.4 INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS\nThere are 20 noxious weed species regulated in Nevada that are known to occur in Clark County. Five of\nthe 20 species are known to occur in or near the DLA (BLM 2019a). Of these five noxious weed species,\ntwo were observed in and around the Project area. One noxious weed, Sahara mustard, was encountered\nin the Project area during vegetation sampling, and the other, saltcedar (Tamarix sp.), was observed\n52\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nduring windshield surveys (Figure 3-9) (SWCA 2023a). Table 3-36 summarizes the number of noxious\nweeds observed. Seven invasive weed species were observed in the Project area: saltlover (Halogeton\nglomeratus), prickly Russian thistle (Salsola tragus), redstem stork\u2019s bill (Erodium cicutarium), African\nmustard (Strigosella africana), red brome, cheatgrass, and Mediterranean grass. Surveys for invasive and\nnoxious weeds were completed throughout the Project area, including windshield surveys along drivable\nroads within a 1-mile buffer of the Project area, excluding I-15.\n3.3.9.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to vegetation would occur. Existing conditions and trends would\ncontinue to affect vegetation in the analysis area, which would be managed consistent with the objectives\nof the BLM Las Vegas RMP (BLM 1998). The land would remain available for future solar energy\nprojects because of its location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.9.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nImplementation of the Proposed Action would result in direct and indirect impacts to vegetation\ncommunities through overland travel, clear and cut/drive and crush, and direct removal of plant material\nand soil (including cacti and yucca, soil seedbanks, and biotic soils) over 69.8% of the Project area, where\nthe land is prepared for Project components. Installation of the components would result in a long-term\nimpact to vegetation communities through the disturbance of approximately 1,174.9 acres (see Table 2-2).\nImpacts vary by the type of preconstruction site preparation and construction techniques employed.\nGrading and leveling (clear and cut with soil removal) involves removing vegetation and surface soils to\ncreate a flat surface. This method would be used in surface preparation for primary roads, inverters, and\nbuildings. It would also be used in some targeted areas within panel array blocks with steep slopes, highly\nvariable terrain, or dense vegetation with large, sharp stumps that can damage equipment. In some cases,\nsuch as inverter and substation foundations, excavation would be used in which surface and subsurface\nsoils are removed to a depth of 12 inches or greater. Grading, leveling, and excavation with soil removal\n(estimated to occur on approximately 310.1 acres or 26.4% of the 1,174.9 acres of expected disturbance)\n(see Table 2-2) would disturb the soil and would therefore be expected to lead to long-term impacts\nrelated to soil seed banks, weed invasion of disturbed areas, and loss of perennial vegetation, which could\ntake centuries to recolonize the site even with restoration (Grodsky and Hernandez 2020; Kobelt 2020).\nDrive and crush or clear and cut (D-2 soil disturbances) would be used in conjunction with overland\ntravel (D-1 soil disturbance) to construct the panel array blocks. Areas where vegetation is only partially\ncrushed (D-1 soil disturbance) (approximately 28.6% of the total expected disturbance; see Table 2-2) are\nanticipated to recover relatively quickly after construction completion (<5 years). Areas where vegetation\nis completely crushed, and where soils are very heavily compacted (D-2 soil disturbance) (approximately\n45.0% of the total expected disturbance; see Table 2-2) are anticipated to take longer to recover (5\u201310\nyears). Some areas of D-2 soil disturbance (e.g., access routes between panel arrays) would be needed\nduring operations and decommissioning of the Project, and would therefore be unlikely to progress\ntoward recovery during the lifetime of the Project. However, the soil seed banks in these areas are being\nmaintained, which would facilitate eventual restoration of the Project area after decommissioning.\nVegetation mowing would be a part of maintenance activities. Vegetation would be mowed or trimmed to\nmaintain a height of no shorter than 18 inches aboveground, assuming this height meets the 12-inch\nminimum clearance requirements for the PV systems. This method involves a commercial-sized raised\ndeck mower and is considered a D-1 soil disturbance. Vegetation cover would be reduced by mowing, but\nmowing is not anticipated to impact the longevity of vegetation within the Project area.\n53\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nLong-term impacts are anticipated throughout the Project area where direct disturbance occurs,\nparticularly in D-3 soil disturbance areas (see Table 2-2). D-2 soil disturbance areas would also have\nlong-term impacts, particularly where access routes are used during Project operations, maintenance, and\ndecommissioning. All forms of site preparation and construction would result in disturbance or alteration\nof soils and vegetation communities by driving across the site with machinery, direct contact with blades,\nsoil trenching, and excavation. Where soil disturbance is incorporated into site preparation, there would\nbe long-term impacts that would persist well past the anticipated 30-year ROW period (Abella 2010;\nChambers et al. 2013; Copeland et al. 2017; Lovich and Bainbridge 1999; Lovich and Ennen 2011; Sinha\net al. 2018). Disturbance of soils results in loss of the soil seed bank, which not only results in a loss of\ndiversity from the area, but also creates pressure on native seed sources in the Mojave Desert, since most\nof the commercial seed available for restoration comes from wildland collections. Soil disturbance also\nincreases the likelihood of invasive species introductions and spread and makes management and long-\nterm restoration of the site more difficult (Chambers et al. 2013).\nShort-term impacts (D-1 and D-2 soil disturbance areas) would occur on approximately 73.6% of the\ndevelopable acres through construction (see Table 2-2). D-1 soil disturbance areas (where vegetation is\nonly minimally impacted) and D-2 soil disturbance areas (not used for access during Project operation),\nwould recover over shorter time periods (2\u201310 years). Any D-3 soil disturbance areas not needed long\nterm for operations would also be restored. This would include laydown areas or launch pads, for\nexample, and any other temporary impacts described in the PODs.\nImplementation of the Restoration and Decommissioning Plan would reduce short-term and long-term\neffects on vegetation from these impacts, but some impacts would remain anywhere there is soil\ndisturbance. Project implementation would result in a long-term alteration of the existing function and\ndiversity of the vegetative communities, particularly anywhere grading has occurred.\n3.3.9.5.1 GENERAL VEGETATION\nConstruction impacts to vegetation communities would occur through grading, leveling, excavation,\nmowing, crushing, and overland travel, as previously discussed. Most of the Project-related impacts\nwould occur within the Sonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White Bursage Desert Scrub vegetation\ncommunity, which covers 96.2% of the Project area. Construction impacts would alter vegetation\ncommunities throughout the Project area, especially where soil disturbance takes place, resulting in long-\nterm impacts. There would be impacts to adjacent vegetation communities from edge effects and\ncolonization and the spread of nonnative and invasive species. Implementation of the Project design\nfeatures and stipulations for vegetation and soils (see Appendix E) would help reduce Project impacts;\nhowever, impacts would remain anywhere there is soil disturbance. Project impacts would affect 1.6% of\nthe Sonora-Mojave Creosotebush-White Bursage Desert Scrub vegetation community in the analysis area.\nThis level of impact is unlikely to affect the overall vegetation community in the analysis area.\n3.3.9.5.2 CACTI AND YUCCA\nConstruction impacts to cacti and yucca would be the removal of up to 4,679 total cactus individuals.\nImpact to cacti and yucca is dependent on the disturbance type, and not all 4,679 total cactus and yucca\nindividuals are expected to be removed. Cacti may be able to recover in areas of D-1 soil disturbance (see\nTable 2-2). Given the slow regeneration of cacti and yucca, this would be a permanent loss of cacti and\nyucca anywhere D-2 or D-3 soil disturbance is used in the Project area as it is unlikely these species\nwould recolonize the site within several centuries given the loss of seed bank. Given this, up to 3,340 total\ncactus and yucca individuals may be impacted within D-2 and D-3 soil disturbance areas. Cacti typically\nreproduce through vegetative propagation and not from seed, and so are difficult to reestablish in\ndisturbed areas. Mojave yucca are very long-lived and would take several hundred years to reach\n54\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nmaturity. However, the cacti and yucca in the Project area are relatively common in the analysis area and\nMojave Desert.\n3.3.9.5.3 INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS WEEDS\nInvasive plant species, including Mediterranean grass, prickly Russian thistle, and saltlover, are present in\nthe Project area. One Nevada State-designated noxious weed species, Sahara mustard, was observed in\nthe Project area with an estimated population of 4,853 individuals. Implementation of the Project would\ntemporarily remove some invasive species and noxious weeds through Project construction; however,\ndisturbance of soil increases the potential spread of invasive species in the soil seed bank (BLM 2020).\nThe Proposed Action\u2019s soil disturbance could cause increased species densities and the introduction of\nother invasive or noxious weed species adjacent to the areas of construction impacts (Chambers, Bradley,\net al. 2014; Chambers, Pyke, et al. 2014). This would affect the surrounding landscape by modifying\nnative plant assemblages, reducing biodiversity, increasing competition with native species, and\npotentially increasing fire hazards. Project design features and stipulations, including the Weed\nManagement Plan, would reduce some of these potential impacts. The invasive and noxious weed\nmitigation measures (see Section 3.3.9.7) would reduce the potential for weeds to be brought in from\nexternal sources and would also require a person familiar with invasive species to be on-site periodically\nduring construction and operations to identify any invasive species brought in or occurring on-site.\nApplication of these measures would reduce the risk of invasive species entering the Project area from\nother locations and increase the likelihood that, if located within the Project area, invasive species would\nbe promptly identified and removed. Residual effects that would remain after application of the mitigation\nmeasures would be some continued risk, albeit reduced, of invasive species moving into the Project area\nfrom external sources. However, the Project would likely result in a higher cover and density of invasive\nplant species in the Project area and adjacent habitat over time due to the loss of biotic soil crusts and\ndesert pavements that help control nonnative plant invasion.\n3.3.9.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for vegetation is the same as the analysis area described in Section\n3.3.9.2. Cumulative effects on vegetation from the development of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:41) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-104). Reasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect vegetation in the\nanalysis area include the development of utility projects and an industrial park (APEX Industrial Park,\nTransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex Generating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line,\nNV Energy Overhead Distribution System, Greenlink West Transmission Project, Southern Bighorn Solar\nProjects, and the Chuckwalla Solar Projects). Cumulatively, these projects could result in up to 21,485\nacres of permanent vegetation disturbance or loss. Of the 1,174.9 acres of expected Project disturbance,\n335.6 acres would be D-1 soil disturbance, 529.2 acres would be D-2 soil disturbance, and 310.1 acres\nwould be D-3 soil disturbance (see Table 2-2). D-1 and D-2 soil disturbances are expected to recover in 2\nto 10 years, whereas D-3 soil disturbances are expected to be long term or permanent. Therefore,\ndevelopment of the Project would cause an additional 310.1 acres of permanent vegetation disturbance or\nloss, which would be an incremental increase of 1.4% to the 21,485-acre total. There would also be\ncumulative impacts in the form of degradation of plant communities and increased probability of weed\ninvasions.\n3.3.9.7 Mitigation Measures\n\u2022 No external substrates (gravel/soil/mulch) will be brought in without specific approval from\nBLM.\n\u2022 All materials brought in (rocks, soils, etc.) must be certified weed free.\n55\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n\u2022 All vehicles must be cleaned of all dirt, mud, and seeds, before they enter the site.\n\u2022 A dedicated weed specialist will be on-site during construction and operations. BLM will\nevaluate the risk assessment for the Project and determine an appropriate schedule for the weed\nspecialist to be on-site during construction and operations and the specific qualifications for that\nposition.\n3.3.10 Visual Resources\n3.3.10.1 Introduction\nVisual resources (the landscape) consist of landforms (topography and soils), vegetation, bodies of water\n(lakes, streams, and rivers), and human-made structures (roads, buildings, and modifications of the land,\nvegetation, and water). These elements of the landscape can be described in terms of their form, line,\ncolor, and texture.\nProject scoping identified the following visual resources issue for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project affect existing visual character and scenic quality and views\nfrom sensitive viewing locations, and would the Project be in or out of conformance with BLM\nVRM class objectives?\n3.3.10.2 Analysis Area\nBased on the issues identified for visual resources, this section focuses on three components: 1) visual (or\nlandscape) character and scenic quality, including BLM visual resource inventory (VRI) data; 2) viewing\nlocations and KOPs; and 3) conformance with BLM VRM class objectives. These components were\ninventoried within the visual resources analysis area, defined as the area within 5 miles of the proposed\ngen-tie line and BESS, with the analysis area for the proposed solar panels extending out 15 miles. These\nanalysis areas correspond to the threshold between the BLM\u2019s foreground/middle ground visual distance\nzone (0\u20135 miles) for the proposed gen-tie line and BESS and background distance zone (5\u201315 miles) for\nthe proposed solar panels (BLM 1986a). Impacts to visual resources would last until Project termination\nand reclamation is complete; the life of the Project is approximately 30 years.\n3.3.10.3 Affected Environment\n3.3.10.3.1 LANDSCAPE CHARACTER AND BLM VRI\nThe term visual (or landscape) character refers to the overall visual appearance of a given landscape based\non the visual aspects of the landscape\u2019s vegetation, landforms/water, and human-made modifications.\nLandscape character is often confused with the term scenic quality, which instead refers to the relative\nvalue of a landscape\u2019s visual character. To describe scenery at the Project level, it is first important to\nunderstand how the scenery in the Project area fits into the regional scale.\nThe visual analysis area is in the Great Basin section of the larger Basin and Range physiographic\nprovince (Fenneman 1931). The Great Basin physiographic section is characterized by isolated, parallel,\nnorth/south-oriented mountain ranges, typically 50 to 75 miles long, that are surrounded by nearly level,\ntypically undrained basins. Gently sloping alluvial fans often occur at the interface between the mountains\nand basins, which are commonly braided by intermittently flowing shallow drainages. These landscapes\nare heavily influenced by the arid climate, resulting in distinct and predictable vegetation patterns. The\nLevel IV ecoregions (Bryce et al. 2003) further define the analysis area as part of the Eastern Mojave\nBasin ecoregion within the Mojave Basin and Range. This ecoregion is characterized by flat to slightly\nrolling valleys vegetated with scattered to dense creosote bush (and other arid-adapted shrubs).\n56\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nThe Project area is defined by the level Dry Lake Basin occurring between the Dry Lake Range to the east\nand Arrow Canyon Range to the west, which appear rugged with swirling and blocky rock layering.\nAlong the west side of Dry Lake Valley, alluvial fans connect the flat basin with the rugged Arrow\nCanyon Range. Vegetation in the basin is mostly limited to low, evenly spaced scattered shrubs (e.g.,\ncreosote bush) and grasses that form distinct edges at fence lines, roads, and other linear features within\nthe landscape. There is limited availability of water in these landscapes, with no known springs or\nintermittent streams in the analysis area.\nThe existing landscape character in portions of the analysis area is heavily modified by existing solar\ndevelopment, multiple existing transmission lines of various shapes and sizes, the Harry Allen Substation,\na landfill, a pig farm, and industrial use near Garnet. Additionally, I-15 and a rail line running adjacent to\nthe Dry Lake Range introduce long, flat, linear modifications into a landscape defined by energy and\nutility development. For additional narrative description of the existing landscape character, refer to the\nDry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:41\u201342).\nThe BLM inventories scenic values for land it administers in accordance with BLM Manual 8410-1 based\non the following factors: 1) scenic quality rating units (SQRUs), 2) sensitivity level rating units (SLRUs),\nand 3) visual distance zones. Together, these factors determine VRM classes, which indicate the existing\nvisual values of BLM-administered land. The Southern Nevada District Office completed its VRI in 2011,\nwith updates made in 2022 (BLM 2011, 2022). The Project would be fully located in the Dry Lake Valley\nSQRU (Class C), avoiding the Dry Lake Range SQRU (Class C) associated with the ridgeline to the east\nof the Project area, paralleling the existing rail line. As identified in the VRI, these landscapes have been\nmodified by multiple power lines, a waste disposal facility, and other industrial operations that have\nresulted in a reduction of these landscapes\u2019 intrinsic scenic quality. Based on the planning-level BLM\nVRI, the Project would be located in a high sensitivity SLRU associated with the Old Spanish National\nHistoric Trail (NHT), with the SLRU stretching from the Arizona\u2013Nevada border to Las Vegas. Through\nProject-level viewshed analysis, as depicted on Figure 3-10, the Project\u2019s proposed solar arrays, gen-tie\nline, and other features would not be visible from high potential route segments, high potential historic\nsites, or auto tour routes associated with the Old Spanish NHT, which is further discussed in the\nsubsequent Viewing Locations and Key Observation Points section. Due to its proximity to I-15, the\nProject would be located within the foreground/middle ground visual distance zone (0\u20135 miles). Based on\nthe above VRI factors, the Project would be in an area of BLM VRM Class III, as inventoried by the\nSouthern Nevada District Office.\nRegarding dark night skies, as described in the Dry Lake East DLA EA:\nDark skies in the Dry Lake Area are impacted by the light pollution from Las Vegas and\nsurrounding light centers. Additionally, nighttime traffic along Interstate 15 and\nsurrounding roads as well as nearby buildings and businesses contribute to the nighttime\nlighting near the Dry Lake Area. (BLM 2019a:42)\nBased on this level of existing light pollution affecting dark night sky resources, no additional analysis of\nnighttime lighting was conducted. Long-term impacts to dark night skies would be minimized through the\napplication of BMPs from BLM Technical Note 457, Night Sky and Dark Environments: Best\nManagement Practices for Artificial Light at Night on BLM-Managed Lands (BLM 2023d) in\ndevelopment of the Project\u2019s Lighting Plan.\n3.3.10.3.2 VIEWING LOCATIONS AND KEY OBSERVATION POINTS\nThe identification of viewing locations and KOPs form the basis for determining impacts to views as well\nas the assessment of conformance with BLM VRM classes. KOPs are defined in BLM Manual 8400 as\n\u201cone or a series of points on a travel route or at a use area or potential use area, where the view of a\nmanagement activity would be most revealing\u201d (BLM 1984:8). BLM Manual 8431 expands on this\n57\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\ndefinition for assessing linear projects (i.e., gen-tie line), which should be analyzed from several\nviewpoints representing:\n\u2022 Most critical viewpoints (e.g., views from communities, road crossings)\n\u2022 Typical views encountered in representative landscapes, if not covered by critical viewpoints\n\u2022 Any special project or landscape features such as skyline crossing, river crossings, substations,\netc. (BLM 1986b:2)\nFor this analysis, viewing locations were identified where the public would most likely have views of the\nProject. Based on the Project location, most public views would be from adjacent travel routes. A\nviewshed analysis was run from the Project looking outward to determine from where in the landscape the\nProject could be visible, to assist in identifying Project KOP locations. In response to BLM Manual 8431\n(BLM 1986b) requirements, three KOP locations were identified, with two of these KOPs involving the\ndevelopment of visual simulations to illustrate impacts to viewing locations and assess conformance with\nagency visual management objectives.\nIntegral to the identification of KOPs is the determination of anticipated viewer sensitivity levels for each\nKOP, which corresponds to their expected sensitivity to changes in the viewshed. The process for\nassigning sensitivity levels for the Project KOP locations was based on the sensitivity levels criteria in\nBLM Manual 8410-1 (BLM 1986a). The agency-approved KOP locations, the viewer type and viewer\nsensitivity level, rationale for selection, and whether a visual simulation was developed are provided in\nTable 3-37. Figure 3-11 shows the KOP locations in context with Project features and BLM VRM classes.\nAs part of the identification of KOP locations for Project analysis, potential visibility of the Project from\nhigh potential route segments, high potential historic sites, or auto tour routes associated with the Old\nSpanish NHT was reviewed. This assessment of visibility from these trail protection components is\nconsistent with BLM Manual 6280 (BLM 2012c) and incorporates decisions made in the Old Spanish\nNational Historic Trail Comprehensive Administrative Strategy (BLM and National Park Service 2017)\nto protect key portions of the NHT including the California Crossing High Potential Route Segment, the\nclosest identified trail protection component. The Dry Lake East DLA EA identified that \u201cimpacts on the\nOld Spanish NHT are possible, depending on the exact location of eventual development in the Dry Lake\nArea\u201d (BLM 2019a:43). As shown on Figure 3-10, based on the viewshed analysis run from the proposed\nsolar arrays, BESS, gen-tie line, and substation, Project components would not be visible from the\nCalifornia Crossing High Potential Route Segment associated with the Old Spanish NHT. Therefore, no\nBLM Manual 6280 analysis of potential effects on the Old Spanish NHT was developed for the Project.\nFor analysis related to NRHP-eligible or listed sites associated with the Old Spanish NHT, please refer to\nSection 3.3.3.\nSince the Project would be located more than 20 miles from any existing public airport (more than 12\nmiles from Nellis Air Force Base) and based on the extent of existing solar facilities in the analysis area, a\nglint and glare analysis was not completed as part of this EA. This approach is consistent with Federal\nAviation Administration Policy: Review of Solar Energy System Projects on Federally-Obligated Airports\n(Federal Aviation Administration 2021). Design features and stipulations to mitigate potential effects on\nvisual resources as well as to protect dark night skies and eliminate glint and glare would be applied to the\nProject (see Appendix E).\nTo provide specific criteria for assessing impacts to visual resources, including impacts to landscape\ncharacter and views, Table 3-38 provides definitions for negligible, low, moderate, and high impacts. If\nimpacts were found to be between these levels, low\u2013moderate and moderate\u2013high impact levels were\nidentified to provide more granular impact thresholds in describing the intensity (magnitude) of impacts.\n58\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.10.3.3 CONFORMANCE WITH BLM VRM\nThe BLM identifies VRM classes on land it administers through the land-use planning process to guide\nproject-level decisions. The BLM manages visual resource values in accordance with VRM objectives\ndesignated in RMPs. BLM Manual 8431 (BLM 1986b) defines four VRM class objectives (Class I\nthrough Class IV) that describe an allowable level of change that can occur to the landscape character and\nthe allowable amount of attention the change can attract. The Las Vegas RMP (BLM 1998) includes\nadditional management direction associated with visual resources, including the following specific\ndirection regarding VRM class objective language which deviates from those defined in BLM Manual\n8410-1 (bolded below for emphasis).\nObjective\nVS-1. Limit future impacts on the visual and aesthetic character of the public lands.\nManagement Direction\nVS-1-a. Designate 968,890 acres of public lands as VRM Class II and manage to retain\nthe landscape\u2019s existing character. In these areas, authorized actions may not modify\nexisting landscapes or attract the attention of casual viewers.\nVS-1-b. Designate 1,727,870 acres of public lands as VRM Class III for partial retention\nof the existing character of the landscape. In these areas, authorized actions may alter\nthe existing landscape, but not to the extent that they attract or focus attention of\nthe casual viewer.\nVS-1-c. Designate 635,135 acres of public lands as VRM Class IV, which allows\nactivities involving major modification of the landscape\u2019s existing character. Authorized\nactions may create significant landscape alterations and would be obvious to casual\nviewers.\nVS-1-d. Continue to refine the VRM inventory to refine the database, viewsheds, and\nscenic ratings. (BLM 1998:A-3)\nConformance was assessed using the more restrictive definitions contained in the Las Vegas RMP\u2019s\n(BLM 1998) management direction instead of those in BLM Manual 8410-1. As allocated in the Las\nVegas RMP (BLM 1998), most of the Project, including the solar arrays, BESS, substation, and part of\nthe gen-tie line (including the connection to the Harry Allen Substation) would be located in BLM VRM\nClass IV, where authorized actions may create significant landscape alterations that would be obvious to\ncasual viewers. The middle portion of the proposed gen-tie line occurs in BLM VRM Class III, including\nwhere I-15 would be crossed, where authorized actions may alter the existing landscape but not to the\nextent that they attract or focus attention of the casual viewer.\nTo determine conformance with VRM class objectives, a Project-specific analysis from agency-approved\nKOP locations was completed. This analysis focused on identifying the level of visual contrast resulting\nfrom the Project as compared with the existing landscape character, and next, evaluating how well this\nlevel of change aligns with the objectives associated with the applicable VRM class. Contrast rating\nworksheets were prepared using BLM Form 8400-4 for each KOP and are included in Appendix G.\nPhotographs taken at each KOP are also included in Appendix G.\n3.3.10.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. There would be no Project-specific impacts to visual resources. However, existing and\nreasonably foreseeable trends and actions would continue to affect these resources in the analysis area.\nAnticipated land use in the analysis area is projected to include additional solar and other\n59\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nenergy-associated development. The vertical protrusions associated with the existing transmission lines\nare evident throughout the analysis area and would continue to influence viewers and the area\u2019s landscape\ncharacter. In addition, the Project area would remain available for future solar energy projects because of\nits location in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.10.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\n3.3.10.5.1 CONSTRUCTION\n3.3.10.5.1.1 Landscape Character\nImpacts on visual resources during construction would primarily be associated with dust and with\nincreased activity (e.g., the movement of vehicles and equipment) that could attract attention.\nConstruction of the Project would occur for up to 2 years. During construction, the removal of vegetation\nand earthwork would introduce areas of exposed soil, which would contrast with the existing setting until\nvegetation has been restored. Because the underground collection system would be buried, there would be\nnegligible long-term visual effects once successful revegetation occurs. The construction of access roads\nin the level terrain in the analysis area would require minimal ground modification, resulting in negligible\nlong-term visual impacts.\n3.3.10.5.1.2 Viewing Locations\nImpacts common to all KOPs during construction include views of additional vehicular traffic, associated\ndust, and areas of exposed soil after the removal of vegetation and during earthwork activities. These\nimpacts would occur for up to 2 years and would cease after construction is complete and vegetation has\nbeen restored. Views from KOPs 1 and 2 would be most affected as they are located directly adjacent to\nthe proposed solar panels and gen-tie line, with unobstructed views of construction activities. KOP 3\nwould have more distant views of these construction activities. Since KOP 3 is located directly adjacent\nto existing solar development areas, which dominate views from U.S. 93, the effects associated with\nconstruction activities on these views would be negligible.\n3.3.10.5.2 OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE\n3.3.10.5.2.1 Landscape Character and BLM VRI\nThe Project would introduce forms, lines, colors, and textures associated with the solar panels, solar\ntrackers, and BESS that are similar to the existing solar facilities on the west side of I-15. The conversion\nof approximately 917 acres of undeveloped lands to solar panels would generate visual contrast through\ntheir flat, geometric form and dark, slightly reflective surfaces. The addition of the repetitive, vertical\nupright geometric features associated with the solar trackers, fencing, and BESS would be noticeable in\nthe flat, panoramic landscape. However, the level of visual contrast would be minimal due to the presence\nof existing solar development, numerous large-scale transmission lines, the Harry Allen Substation, a\nlandfill, a pig farm, and industrial use near Garnet, which visually influence the landscape setting\nthroughout the analysis area. The addition of the Project would expand the area viewed as modified by\nenergy development to include both sides of I-15 in the Dry Lake Basin SQRU (Class C, within a high\nsensitivity SLRU associated with the Old Spanish NHT). Based on the extent of existing modifications in\nthe landscape, the proposed solar panels, solar trackers, and BESS would be prominent and would begin\nto dominate the setting, resulting in moderate impacts to the area\u2019s landscape character.\nThe proposed gen-tie line would result in tall, vertical transmission line structures being introduced into\nan area parallel to an existing transmission line and in proximity to multiple transmission lines entering\nthe Harry Allen Substation. The proposed gen-tie line would cross the same Dry Lake SQRU and high\nsensitivity SLRU as the proposed solar panels and BESS. Although the Project would be noticeable in the\n60\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nlandscape, based on the existing modifications which have severely altered the landscape character in this\narea, the proposed gen-tie line would result in low impacts to the area\u2019s landscape character.\nWith successful application of mitigation measures (Section 3.3.10.7), visual contrast associated with the\nproposed solar panels, solar trackers, and BESS would be reduced through diminishing the reflectivity of\nthe solar panels, selecting colors for support structures to match the natural setting, limiting color variety\nwithin the Project design, and minimizing the use of lighting to the extent possible to reduce potential\nimpacts to dark night skies. Similarly, the application of mitigation measures to color match the new\ncrossarms with the existing transmission line structures as well as using nonspecular conductors and\nnonreflective insulators would reduce visual contrast associated with the proposed gen-tie line. Although\nthe mitigation measures would result in decreased visual contrast, the residual impacts to landscape\ncharacter and viewing locations would be moderate to low because the Project would still be prominent in\nthe setting and begin to attract the attention of the casual observer from identified viewing locations.\nThe Project would not result in any specific impacts to the BLM VRI beyond those identified on the Dry\nLake Basin SQRU. As described previously, the Project would not be visible from the Old Spanish NHT,\ntherefore minimal impacts to this inventoried high sensitivity SLRU are anticipated with impacts to\nadjacent viewers, including I-15, described in Section 3.3.10.5.2.2. Similarly, the Project would not\nmodify the identification of the BLM foreground/middle ground visual distance zone in the analysis area\nor determination of VRI Class III based on the other VRI factors.\n3.3.10.5.2.2 Viewing Locations\nKOP 1 \u2013 Interstate 15 (southbound): Views for motorists traveling southbound on I-15 would be\nmodified along the east side of the interstate by the introduction of geometric rows of solar arrays with a\nslight blue-gray color and the geometrically shaped BESS. The proposed solar arrays and BESS would be\nvisible and attract attention, beginning to dominate views since these views would occur closer to the\nviewpoint than the existing solar facilities (visible on the west side of the interstate), multiple\ntransmission lines, and industrial buildings visible in Garnet. Based on the flat and gently sloping valley\nfloor and the evenly spaced nature of the vegetation, proposed changes to landforms and vegetation are\nexpected to be visible including the geometrically shaped cleared areas for the solar arrays and BESS.\nThese resulting clearings are anticipated to be visible for observers traveling on I-15 but would repeat\nthose elements associated with other energy development projects in the valley. Although these elements\nrepeat many of the elements associated with the existing landscape modifications, the Project would\nexpand the area viewed as modified by energy development to include both sides of I-15, as well as result\nin moderate impacts to views from this location. Based on these views occurring from an interstate\nhighway, with a posted speed limit of 75 miles per hour, the moderate impacts would be short in duration\nwith impacts diminishing to a low level after less than 2 minutes as motorists pass the Project area.\nIn addition to the solar arrays, the Project would include tall, vertical transmission line structures\nassociated with the proposed gen-tie line and substation. The proposed gen-tie line would be visible from\nthis viewpoint but would not attract the focus of viewers as it would be in proximity to multiple existing\ntransmission lines in the viewshed. Based on the level of contrast introduced by the proposed gen-tie line\nand substation, low impacts to views from KOP 1 are anticipated.\nKOP 2 \u2013 Interstate 15 (northbound): Views for motorists traveling northbound on I-15 would also be\nmodified along the east side of the interstate by the proposed solar arrays. Views of the BESS would be\nscreened from this viewpoint by a ridge paralleling I-15. Based on the extent of topographic screening by\nthis ridge (it would screen a portion of the proposed solar arrays from view) and the distance to the\nProject (approximately 1.5 miles), the proposed solar arrays would be visible and would begin to attract\nthe attention of the casual observer but would not dominate views. Existing views from I-15 include\nnumerous transmission lines, solar development on the west side of the highway, and an elevated rail line\n61\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nlocated near the mountains which currently attracts the attention of viewers along the interstate. Based on\nthe flat and gently sloping valley floor and the evenly spaced nature of the vegetation, proposed changes\nto landforms and vegetation are expected to be visible, including the geometrically shaped cleared areas\nfor the proposed solar arrays. These resulting clearings would likely be visible for observers traveling on\nthe interstate but would repeat those elements associated with other energy development projects in the\nvalley. Although the Project would repeat many of the elements associated with the existing landscape\nmodifications, it would expand the area viewed as modified by energy development to include both sides\nof I-15 resulting in low to low\u2013moderate impacts to views from this location. As motorists continue\nnorthbound, impacts to views would increase, similar to KOP 1, resulting in short-duration (less than 2\nminutes based on highway speeds), moderate impacts along I-15.\nViews of the proposed gen-tie line would occur from approximately 0.5 mile away where the Project\nwould roughly parallel a larger, existing 500-kV transmission line across I-15 and would be in proximity\nto several transmission lines adjacent to the Harry Allen Substation. The proposed substation would not\nbe visible from this location. Based on the slightly superior viewing angle, the proposed transmission line\nstructures would be mostly backdropped by terrain allowing them to begin to blend with the existing\nlandscape. Since the proposed gen-tie line would be visible in context with several transmission lines,\nwhich currently attract attention in the viewshed, the Project is expected to be visible but would not attract\nthe focus of viewers along I-15. Based on the level of contrast introduced by the proposed gen-tie line and\nsubstation, low impacts to views from KOP 2 are anticipated associated with these Project components.\nKOP 3 \u2013 U.S. 93: Views for motorists on U.S. 93 would be modified by the introduction of the proposed\nsolar arrays and BESS approximately 4 miles away. The landscape between the KOP and the Project has\nbeen modified by extensive solar development as well as several existing transmission lines entering the\nHarry Allen Substation. The introduction of the Project would expand the area viewed as modified by\nenergy development to include both sides of I-15. Proposed changes to landforms and vegetation are\nexpected to be visible based on the flat and gently sloping valley floor and the evenly spaced nature of the\nvegetation, including the geometrically shaped cleared areas for the proposed solar arrays. These resulting\nclearings are anticipated to be visible for observers traveling on the highway but would not attract\nattention as they repeat elements associated with other energy development projects in the valley. Based\non the viewing distance and the extent of existing modifications in view, the proposed solar arrays and\nBESS would be visible but would not attract attention of viewers resulting in low impacts to these views.\nViews of the proposed gen-tie line and substation would occur between 2 and 4 miles away where the\nProject would parallel an existing 500-kV transmission line and be in proximity to multiple transmission\nlines, the Harry Allen Substation, and large-scale existing solar facilities. Since the gen-tie line would be\nvisible in context with multiple transmission lines and existing solar development, which currently attract\nand begin to dominate the viewshed, the Project is expected to be visible but would not attract the focus\nof viewers along U.S. 93. Based on the level of contrast introduced by the proposed gen-tie line and\nsubstation, negligible impacts to views from KOP 3 are anticipated with these Project components.\n3.3.10.5.2.3 Conformance with BLM VRM\nThe assessment of conformance with BLM VRM class objectives and the Las Vegas RMP (BLM 1998)\nwas based on results of the KOP contrast rating worksheets contained in Appendix G and an assessment\nof impacts to viewers. Based on the KOP contrast rating worksheets completed from KOPs 1, 2, and 3, it\nwas determined the Project would meet VRM class objectives where BLM-administered lands are\noccupied by the Project. Most of the Project, including the proposed solar arrays, BESS, substation, and a\nportion of the gen-tie line, would be located on lands managed as BLM VRM Class IV, where authorized\nactions may create significant landscape alterations that would be obvious to casual viewers. A segment\nof the gen-tie line would be in BLM VRM Class III (2.1 miles), including the crossing of I-15, where\nauthorized actions may alter the existing landscape but not to the extent that they attract or focus attention\n62\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nof the casual viewer. Specifically, only three new transmission line structures would be located on lands\nmanaged as VRM Class III, with the remaining mileage associated with stringing a second circuit onto\nthe existing Harry Allen to Pecos #1 single-circuit, 230-kV transmission line structures. Based on the\nanalysis from KOPs 1, 2 and 3, the proposed gen-tie line would be visible, but due to the extent of\nexisting modifications in view including several existing transmission lines, the gen-tie line would not\nattract the focus of the casual viewer in this area. Therefore, based on this assessment of visual contrast,\nthe Project would meet BLM VRM Class III and Class IV objectives.\n3.3.10.5.3 DECOMMISSIONING\nDecommissioning would include concentrated activities with increased vehicle and construction\nequipment movement similar to the construction phase of the Project. Ground disturbance associated with\nthese activities and the vehicular traffic on-site would increase short-term visual contrast and would\nattract attention from KOPs, especially from KOPs 1 and 2 where these activities would occur directly\nadjacent to I-15. After the Project has been decommissioned, there would be increased visual contrast\nbetween the color of the exposed soil and adjacent vegetated areas until site reclamation is successful. As\nnoted in Section 3.3.9.2, vegetated areas impacted by clear and cut with soil removal disturbance may\ntake 50 to 200 years post-reclamation to recover.\n3.3.10.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative effects analysis area for visual resources is the same as the analysis area described in\nSection 3.3.10.2. Cumulative impacts to visual resources from the construction and operations of the\nProject would be similar to those described in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:43\u201344) and\nWestern Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104). Reasonably foreseeable future actions in the\nvisual cumulative effects analysis area include APEX Industrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission\nLine, Apex Generating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead\nDistribution System, Greenlink West Transmission Project, Master Plan and Installation Development at\nNellis Air Force Base, Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, Chuckwalla Solar Projects, and the Yahthumb\nSolar Project (see Table 3-1). Cumulatively, these projects could result in up to 23,273 acres of new\ndisturbance. The cumulative effects of all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable development would\nresult in the landscape becoming further dominated by energy and industrial development. This trend\nwould continue from the existing condition, which includes multiple existing transmission lines, the\nexisting Harry Allen Substation, a landfill, a pig farm, industrial use near Garnet, and existing solar\ndevelopment visible on the west side of the interstate, to include solar facilities on both sides of I-15 and\nother large-scale infrastructure projects within the visual cumulative impacts area.\n3.3.10.7 Mitigation Measures\nTo reduce effects from the proposed solar panels, solar trackers, and BESS, the following mitigation\nmeasures are recommended in addition to the stipulations in Appendix E based on direction from the\nBLM\u2019s Best Management Practices for Reducing Visual Impacts of Renewable Energy Facilities on\nBLM-Administered Lands (BLM 2013) and BLM Technical Note 457, Night Sky and Dark Environments:\nBest Management Practices for Artificial Light at Night on BLM-Managed Lands (BLM 2023d):\n\u2022 Use nonreflective materials, finishes, surface treatments or color-treated solar collectors and\nsupport structures.\n\u2022 Use similar color/finish for grouped structures.\n\u2022 Minimize use of lighting during operations and maintenance.\nTo further reduce effects from the proposed gen-tie line, the following mitigation measures are\nrecommended in addition to the design features identified in the Project PODs:\n63\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n\u2022 To the degree practicable, new arms added to existing poles should match the finish/color of the\nexisting transmission line structures to reduce contrast with the existing landscape.\n\u2022 Use nonspecular conductors (physically treated to reduce light reflectance) and nonreflective\ninsulators to reduce potential glare from these Project components.\n3.3.11 Water Resources\n3.3.11.1 Introduction\nThis section provides an overview of the water resources potentially affected by the Proposed Action and\nalternatives. Project scoping identified the following water resources issues for detailed analysis:\n\u2022 What are the impacts from the construction, operations and maintenance, and decommissioning\nof the Project on hydrologic conditions, surface water quality, surface water quantity, and\ngroundwater quantity?\n3.3.11.2 Analysis Area\nThe geographic analysis area for water resources, with the exception of water use, is the approximately\n154,114-acre Dry Lake Valley subwatershed (10-digit HUC 1501001206) that contains the Project area.\nThis analysis area was chosen because it encompasses the area of land that contributes to the terminal\nbasin into which the surface water features and precipitation from the Project area drain; it is a contained\nunit within which impacts to water can be analyzed. The temporal analysis area for hydrologic impacts\nincludes the life of the Project (30 years) until reclamation is complete.\nThe Applicant anticipates that water for Project activities would be obtained from the Southern Nevada\nWater Authority (SNWA), the local commercially available source, and trucked to the Project area to be\nstored as needed. The SNWA sources its water supply from both surface water and groundwater.\nTherefore, the geographic analysis area for water use is the SNWA service area as shown in the SNWA\u2019s\n2023 Water Resource Plan (SNWA 2023a).\n3.3.11.3 Affected Environment\nThe Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:25\u201328) and the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-17\u201311.3-32) describe the hydrologic conditions and water resources in the water resources\nanalysis area. Information regarding local climate and precipitation patterns, surface water features, water\nsupply and uses, floodplains, and impaired waters in the water resources analysis area is summarized\nbelow. Updated data are provided where appropriate.\n3.3.11.3.1 CLIMATE AND PRECIPITATION PATTERNS\nThe water resources analysis area is in the Mojave Desert, which is an arid region with extreme\ntemperature variations that range from above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer to below freezing in\nthe winter. The portion of the Mojave Desert surrounding the water resources analysis area is subject to a\nbi-seasonal precipitation pattern, with winter storms providing approximately 70% and summer storms\nproviding approximately 29% of the annual precipitation (USGS 2005b). Precipitation levels and patterns\ndescribed in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-17\u201311.3-19) and Dry Lake East\nDLA EA (BLM 2019a:25, 39) remain valid for the water resources analysis area, with average annual\nprecipitation at 6.3 inches between 2012 and 2022 at the climate station closest to the Project area (Valley\nof Fire State Park) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2023).\n64\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.11.3.2 SURFACE HYDROLOGY\nThe Dry Lake Valley watershed surrounding the Project area (i.e., the analysis area for hydrology)\ncontains a series of ephemeral washes that carry stormwater toward Dry Lake, a terminal lake basin\ndirectly north and northeast of the Project area. Stormwater in the water resources analysis area either\nevaporates, is transpired by vegetation, or percolates into the soil before or after it is detained in Dry\nLake. Historical flow patterns in the water resources analysis area have been disrupted by existing\ncommercial development, regional highways and local roadways, a railroad track, a solar facility, and the\nHarry Allen Generating Station and Substation facilities.\nBased on the Conceptual Drainage Report for the Project (Revamp Engineering, Inc. 2023), stormwater\nflows across the Dry Lake East Energy Center total 2,588 cubic feet per second at their interception along\nthe length of I-15 immediately downstream of the Project area boundary. On-site flow velocities are\ngenerally less than 1 foot per second but may be up to 7 feet per second at areas of concentrated flow.\nAlthough the National Hydrography Dataset and National Wetlands Inventory identify the surface water\nfeatures in the Project area and the downstream Dry Lake as \u201cintermittent\u201d and \u201cseasonally flooded\u201d\n(USFWS 2022; USGS 2022), all surface water features in the Dry Lake Valley watershed appear to be\nephemeral based on local precipitation data, available aerial photography, and field reconnaissance\nobservations of the Project area (SWCA 2022). The ephemeral features in the Dry Lake Valley watershed\nonly flow during and shortly after local precipitation events.\n3.3.11.3.3 GROUNDWATER HYDROLOGY\nThe water resources analysis area overlies the Garnet Valley groundwater basin, a basin-fill aquifer\nconsisting of unconfined alluvium and lacustrine deposits of sand, silt, and clay. Information regarding\nthe Garnet Valley groundwater basin is provided in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE\n2012:11.3-17\u201311.3-18, 11.3-22) and Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:25). Current records show that\napproximately 3,908 acre-feet of groundwater from the basin are used per year, primarily for municipal\nuses but also for industrial; construction; mining, milling, and dewatering; quasi-municipal; and\ncommercial uses (Nevada Division of Water Resources 2023). Depth to groundwater in the Garnet Valley\ngroundwater basin is more than 200 feet below ground surface (Nevada Division of Water Resources\n2023; Quinn and Carr 2014).\n3.3.11.3.4 WATER USE (SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER)\nThe Applicant anticipates that water for Project activities would be obtained from the SNWA. Given the\nProject location, the source is assumed to be the SNWA. SNWA water supplies include surface water\nfrom the Colorado River and Lake Mead (approximately 90%), Las Vegas Valley groundwater\n(approximately 10%), and other alternate water sources (SNWA 2023b). The SNWA\u2019s alternate water\nsources include Intentionally Created Surpluses, groundwater rights, water reuse, and groundwater stored\nin Southern Nevada, California, and Arizona water banks. The SNWA is entitled to 276,205 acre-feet per\nyear of Colorado River water, plus surplus water (when available) and banked water as outlined in the\nSouthern Nevada Water Authority 2023 Water Resource Plan (SNWA 2023a). As of 2021, the SNWA\nhas accrued more than 2.2 million acre-feet of banked water. SNWA member agencies also hold\ngroundwater rights of approximately 59,766 acre-feet per year. Projected demand for SNWA water is up\nto 286,000 acre-feet per year in 2023 and up to 439,000 acre-feet per year in 2072 (SNWA 2023a).\n3.3.11.3.5 WATER QUALITY (SURFACE WATER)\nNo surface waters in the water resources analysis area are designated by the EPA or Nevada Division of\nEnvironmental Protection (2022, 2023) as impaired or threatened by pollutants. Water provided by the\nSNWA would be subject to treatment prior to delivery (SNWA 2023c). SNWA water supply from Lake\n65\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nMead is treated with chlorine and then sent to a water treatment facility for ozonation and a multistage\nfiltration system; SNWA water supply from groundwater is naturally filtered but is also treated with\nchlorine before delivery (SNWA 2023d).\n3.3.11.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants, the Project would not be\nconstructed, and current conditions would continue. No Project-specific impacts to water resources would\noccur. Water resources would continue to be managed consistent with the objectives of the Las Vegas\nRMP (BLM 1998). The land would remain available for future solar energy projects because of its\nlocation in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n3.3.11.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\nThe Proposed Action would result in impacts to surface waters and groundwater. Impacts would be the\nsame or similar to impacts described in the Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-18\u201311.3-\n31) and Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:26\u201327).\nThe Proposed Action would directly and indirectly impact surface water quality and quantity (i.e.,\nephemeral streams, floodplains) and local groundwater recharge rates due to temporary and permanent\nland disturbance. Water would be directly impacted due to the water needs during construction,\noperations, and decommissioning. Surface water quality may be degraded through hazardous material\nspills and increased erosion and sedimentation in disturbed areas. Design features, stipulations, and\nmitigation measures would be followed to minimize or avoid impacts to water resources (Section 2.2.7).\nAuthorized grading and leveling would be done only in areas where the elevation needs to be changed to\naccommodate the improvements (estimated at 310.1 acres of the 1,174.9 acres of expected disturbance;\nsee Table 2-2), thereby minimizing disturbance to washes and drainage patterns. Stormwater drainage\npatterns would be altered to redirect flows into five main channels using diversion berms and stream\nchannelization, with rock check dams to control velocities. Riprap in select locations and reinforced road-\nway sections at maintenance road crossings are proposed to control erosion. Stormwater would continue\nto flow through the site and discharge downstream through existing culverts under I-15. Drainage is\ndiscussed in the Conceptual Drainage Report (Revamp Engineering, Inc. 2023); a detailed Stormwater\nQuality Management Plan and Technical Drainage Plan would be developed during final design.\nThe Proposed Action is not anticipated to contribute to future changes to precipitation levels or patterns or\nflooding potential due to climate change. However, extreme weather events due to climate change may\ncause increased occurrences of severe flooding or storms that could damage PV arrays or other\ninfrastructure and increase the frequency of maintenance activities. Drainage and flood control systems\n(e.g., diversion berms, channelized streams, reinforced roadway sections at maintenance road crossings,\nrock check dams, and riprap bank protection) would be implemented to minimize future risk to the\nproposed structures and downstream drainage features.\n3.3.11.5.1 QUANTITY\nAs described in Section 2.2.2.9 and Table 2-5, Project construction activities are anticipated to use up to\n1.1 acre-feet of water per day for the duration of construction (up to 2 years), and operations and\nmaintenance activities are anticipated to use approximately 40 acre-feet of water per year. Water would\nbe trucked to the site and stored in aboveground tanks with a storage capacity of up to 250,000 gallons\n(0.77 acre-foot). Water use during decommissioning is unknown but anticipated to be similar to\nconstruction activities for the purposes of this assessment. Based on those estimates, total water use\nwould be approximately 260,681,141 gallons (800 acre-feet) during 2 years of construction, 391,021,712\ngallons (1,200 acre-feet) during 30 years of operations, and approximately 260,681,141 gallons (800 acre-\n66\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nfeet) during decommissioning. On a per-year basis, the Project would use between 40 acre-feet per year\nduring operations and maintenance activities and 400 acre-feet per year during construction and\ndecommissioning. The Project\u2019s water use would contribute to the overall water use in the SNWA service\narea, as discussed in Section 3.3.11.6.\nLocal groundwater recharge would be affected by the removal of vegetation and installation of permanent\nimpervious structures, such as paved roadways. These effects would be minimized through revegetation\nof temporarily disturbed areas, allowing regrowth of vegetation beneath the PV modules, and\nimplementation of stormwater drainage management and flood control systems. Washes would be left in\ntheir natural condition wherever practicable.\n3.3.11.5.2 QUALITY\nIf not properly contained, hazardous materials used during construction and operations (e.g., fuels, oils,\nlubricants, paints, solvents, cleaning solutions) have the potential to enter surface waters. Implementation\nof the Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Plan and the Spill Prevention, Control, and\nCountermeasures Plan would minimize the risk of hazardous material releases.\nThe Project would require a Nevada Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Construction General Permit\nfrom the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The permit requires preparation and\nimplementation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The SWPPP would identify\npotential sources of pollution, describe the best management practices that would be used to reduce the\npollutants in stormwater discharges associated with construction activities, and provide methods for how\nthey would be implemented. Erosion control methods may include construction of water diversion\nstructures and site-specific applications of best management practices to control surface water runoff\nacross disturbed areas. Additionally, a Stormwater Quality Management Plan would be prepared and\nimplemented during operations to reduce the discharge of pollutants from storm events. The Stormwater\nQuality Management Plan would include best management practices for managing the volume, rate, and\nquality of water runoff from the site. Project stipulations are listed in Appendix E.\n3.3.11.5.3 CONNECTIVITY\nSome ephemeral washes that carry stormwater flows across the Project area would be impacted by\ngrading and leveling for access and in preparation for installation of Project components. However,\ngrading would be limited to the extent practicable, and the macro-level topography and stormwater\ndrainage would remain similar to pre-graded conditions. The washes would not be impounded, and flows\nwould continue through the site. Overall drainage patterns in the analysis area would remain similar to\nexisting conditions. The proposed solar array layout includes areas free of panels along the larger wash\ncorridors that would maintain natural drainage patterns (see Figures 2-1 through 2-7).\n3.3.11.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe cumulative impact analysis area is the Dry Lake Valley subwatershed for surface waters, the Garnet\nValley groundwater basin for groundwater, and the SNWA service area for water use. Impacts to water\nquantity, quality, and connectivity from the Proposed Action would contribute to the cumulative effect of\nother projects in these analysis areas. Cumulative effects on water resources from Project development\nwould be similar to those described in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:27) and Western Solar\nPlan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-104).\nReasonably foreseeable future projects with the potential to affect surface water in the Dry Lake Valley\nsubwatershed include the development of APEX Industrial Park and several utility projects (i.e., Apex\nGenerating Station to Crystal Substation Transmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System for\nApex Nevada Communication Site, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Greenlink West Transmission\n67\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nProject, Southern Bighorn Solar Projects, and the Chuckwalla Solar Projects) (see Table 3-1). The\nProposed Action would minimally contribute to impacts to ephemeral washes.\nThe development of APEX Industrial Park and the utility projects in the Garnet Valley groundwater basin\nmay impact local groundwater levels by removing vegetation and installing permanent impervious\nstructures, which may affect local groundwater recharge rates. The contribution of the Proposed Action to\nthis effect would be minimal due to revegetation of temporarily disturbed areas, allowing regrowth of\nvegetation beneath the PV modules, and implementation of stormwater drainage management and flood\ncontrol systems.\nRegarding water use, the Proposed Action would contribute to the projected increase in water demand in\nthe region. The estimated demand for water in the SNWA service area (i.e., the geographic analysis area\nfor water use) is used as a proxy for cumulative water use. Future development in the SNWA service area\nis projected to result in an up to 54% increase in demand for water by 2072 (from 286,000 acre-feet for\n2023 to 439,000 acre-feet for 2072 [SNWA 2023a]). The Southern Nevada Water Authority 2023 Water\nResource Plan projects a high probability of a future shortage of surface water supply during their 50-year\nplanning horizon due to declining water levels in the Colorado River and Lake Mead. Lake Mead and the\nLower Colorado River operated in a Tier 2 shortage in 2023 but will operate in a Tier 1 water shortage in\n2024 due to above-average precipitation and snowmelt levels in 2023 (Nilsen 2023). The SNWA is a\nparty to the Lower Colorado Drought Contingency Plan Agreement (Bureau of Reclamation 2019) to\nmitigate drought impacts. Negotiations for necessary future cutbacks from the seven Colorado River\nBasin states are currently ongoing.\n3.3.12 Wildlife (including special-status species)\n3.3.12.1 Introduction\nFish and wildlife species analyzed in this section include all wildlife species that are not federally\ndesignated as threatened, endangered, or candidate species (which are analyzed in the Threatened,\nEndangered, and Candidate Animal Species section). This section includes evaluation of general wildlife\n(reptiles and small mammals), special-status wildlife species, and migratory birds.\nProject scoping identified the following wildlife (including special-status species) issue for detailed\nanalysis:\n\u2022 How would the proposed Project impact wildlife species and wildlife habitat?\n3.3.12.2 Analysis Area\nThe analysis area for wildlife (with the exception of bald eagles [Haliaeetus leucocephalus] and golden\neagles [Aquila chrysaetos]) is the Project area plus an approximately 1-mile buffer, consisting of a total of\napproximately 11,519 acres. This analysis area is intended to capture existing conditions and potential\nimpacts to individuals and adjacent habitats. The analysis area for bald and golden eagles is an\napproximately 2-mile radius around the Project area totaling approximately 24,294 acres. This analysis\narea is intended to capture potential nesting areas and potential impacts to foraging habitat and is based on\nupdated eagle nest survey protocol (USFWS 2020).\nWildlife impacts would generally last until Project termination and reclamation is complete (the Project\nhas a life of approximately 30 years). Impacts would be permanent if individuals (e.g., reptiles and small\nmammals) are killed during Project activities.\n68\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.12.3 Affected Environment\n3.3.12.3.1 GENERAL WILDLIFE\nThe analysis area supports a variety of desert-adapted wildlife species that use the vegetation\ncommunities described in Section 3.3.9.3. There are no permanent natural or developed sources of water\nin the analysis area. Wildlife species with the potential to use the habitat(s) in the analysis area and those\nrecorded during site visits are those representative and affiliated with desertscrub communities.\nReptile species likely to occur in the analysis area include Mojave desert tortoise (discussed in Section\n3.3.8), long-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia wislizenii), side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana\nstejnegeri), zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), Great Basin western whiptail (Aspidoscelis\ntigris ssp. tigris), coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum ssp. flagellum), Mohave patch-nosed snake\n(Salvadora hexalepis mojavensis), northern Mohave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus), and\nsidewinder (Crotalus cerastes).\nThe mammalian fauna within the analysis area is dominated by small, mostly nocturnal species of rodents\nsuch as kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) and deer mice (Peromyscus spp.). Other mammal species known\nto occur include black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), a nocturnal hare, and white-tailed antelope\nsquirrel (Ammospermophilus leucurus), a diurnal rodent. Several bat species may use rocky outcrops,\ncliffs with crevices, caves, and/or abandoned mines within the analysis area as roosting habitat. However,\nthere are no known abandoned mine lands within 1 mile of the Project area (special-status bat species are\ndiscussed in the Special-Status Wildlife section below), though crevice habitat may be present. Larger\nmammalian species that are likely present include coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon\ncinereoargenteus), and American badger (Taxidea taxus).\nDesert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) is the only big-game species with identified habitat in the\nanalysis area (Nevada Department of Wildlife [NDOW] 2023). Approximately 383 acres of desert\nbighorn sheep habitat, classified as an occupied, limited use distribution area for the desert bighorn sheep\nMuddy Herd, overlaps the southern portion of the Project area (Figure 3-12).\n3.3.12.3.2 SPECIAL-STATUS WILDLIFE\nSome wildlife species are accorded special status by federal and state agencies largely because they are\neither scarce on a regional level, facing clearly defined threats, or in a position in the regional landscape\nto potentially become scarce. Special-status animal species are those that require specific management\nattention as a result of population or habitat concerns. Special-status species include the following\ndesignations:\n\u2022 BLM-designated sensitive species designated by the BLM Nevada State Director. Sensitive\nspecies are those species requiring special management consideration to promote their\nconservation and reduce the likelihood and need for future listing under the ESA. In addition to\nthose species designated as sensitive by the State Director, all federal candidate species and\ndelisted species in the 5 years following delisting are to be conserved as BLM sensitive species.\nSensitive species are managed as special-status species, along with federally listed and proposed\nspecies, which are automatically treated as special-status species.\n\u2022 At-risk taxa tracked by the NDNH.\n\u2022 Avian species protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA).\n\u2022 Avian species protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA).\nSpecies identified for analysis were identified from the BLM Southern Nevada District Office list of\nSensitive Species (BLM 2023e), species protected by the State of Nevada (Nevada Administrative Code\n69\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n527), species managed by NDOW as species of greatest conservation need (NDOW 2022), and the listing\nof special-status species maintained by the NDNH (2023).\nData obtained from the BLM, NDNH, and NDOW indicate that habitats located in the analysis area may\nbe suitable for approximately 97 different special-status wildlife species, or the analysis area is within the\npotential range for these species. Based on a review of habitat requirements and historic and recent\nobservations, 48 of these species have been determined to have the potential to occur in the analysis area\nand/or have been observed during site-specific biological field surveys. These species include 18 bird\nspecies, one invertebrate species, 20 mammal species, and nine reptile species. Table 3-39 provides detail\non the individual special-status wildlife species that may be present; migratory birds are discussed as a\ngroup in Section 3.3.12.3.3.\n3.3.12.3.3 MIGRATORY BIRDS\nInformation about migratory birds that are likely to occur in the analysis area was obtained from a variety\nof sources, including agency coordination and desktop analysis of publicly available databases and\ndocuments (eBird 2023; Floyd et al. 2007; NDNH 2022; NDOW 2022; USFWS 2023). Additionally, the\nWestern Solar Plan PEIS describes the types and species of birds known and expected to occur in SEZs\n(BLM and DOE 2012).\nMigratory bird species known to occur in the analysis area are those commonly found in the Mojave\nDesert ecoregion. Many of these species are neotropical migrants, and include ash-throated flycatcher\n(Myiarchus cinerascens), Bewick\u2019s wren (Thryomanes bewickii), black-tailed gnatcatcher (Polioptila\nmelanura), black-throated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), Brewer\u2019s sparrow (Spizella breweri), cactus\nwren (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus), common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii), common raven\n(Corvus corax), Costa\u2019s hummingbird (Calypte costae), crissal thrasher (Toxostoma crissale), greater\nroadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), ladder-backed woodpecker\n(Dryobates scalaris), LeConte\u2019s thrasher (Toxostoma lecontei), lesser nighthawk (Chordeiles\nacutipennis), loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), Lucy\u2019s warbler (Leiothlypis luciae), northern\nmockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), rock wren (Salpinctes obsoletus), sagebrush sparrow (Artemisiospiza\nnevadensis), Say\u2019s phoebe (Sayornis saya), verdin (Auriparus flaviceps), and western kingbird (Tyrannus\nverticalis).\nRaptors and other birds of prey that may occur in the analysis area include American kestrel (Falco\nsparverius), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), golden eagle, great horned owl (Bubo virginianus),\nlong-eared owl (Asio otus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura).\nWhile conducting Mojave desert tortoise presence/absence surveys for the Project, biologists recorded\none burrowing owl adult and one burrow with sign of owl use (whitewash and feathers at the entrance of\nthe burrow) (SWCA 2023b).\nWaterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds are not generally expected to occur in the analysis area due to\nthe lack of aquatic habitats; however, killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), which often occurs in uplands, is\nthe shorebird identified as most likely to occur.\n3.3.12.4 Environmental Effects of the No Action Alternative\nUnder the No Action Alternative, the BLM would not issue the ROW grants and the Project would not be\nconstructed. No Project-specific impacts to wildlife (including special-status species) would occur.\nExisting conditions and trends would continue to affect wildlife populations and habitat in the analysis\narea under this alternative. The land would remain available for future solar energy projects because of its\nlocation in the Dry Lake East DLA.\n70\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n3.3.12.5 Environmental Effects of the Proposed Action\n3.3.12.5.1 GENERAL AND SPECIAL-STATUS WILDLIFE\nImpacts to wildlife (including special-status species) from the construction and operations of the Project\nwould be similar to those described in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:53\u201360) and Western\nSolar Plan PEIS (BLM and DOE 2012:11.3-35\u201311.3-40). Impacts to wildlife during construction would\ninclude destruction and modification of wildlife habitat, habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow,\ndirect mortality, increased noise, and increased human activity. Implementation of the Proposed Action\nwould result in short-term disturbance of approximately 880.2 acres of habitat (approximately 7.6% of the\nwildlife analysis area) and long-term loss of approximately 294.7 acres of wildlife habitat (approximately\n2.6% of the analysis area), which would remain disturbed until Project reclamation is complete (see Table\n2-2 for temporary and permanent disturbance acreages; see Table 3-32 for vegetation cover types subject\nto disturbance). Most of this acreage would be fenced throughout the life of the Project. Ground\ndisturbance from construction would be minimized to maintain vegetative cover (see Section 2.2.2.4).\nConstruction activities have the potential to result in injury or direct mortality via crushing or burying\nsmaller or less-mobile individuals (such as small mammals or reptiles) that are unable to escape into\nadjacent habitat. Construction vehicles and/or equipment could injure or kill wildlife species along\nregional roadways and site access roads via vehicle strikes. All Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum)\n(and any Mojave fringe-toed lizards [Uma scoparia]) encountered during construction would be reported\nto NDOW consistent with their reporting protocol (NDOW 2020). Grading, roads, and fences not only\nfragment habitat but also can cause habitat degradation and increase some species\u2019 vulnerability to\npredators (Moore-O\u2019Leary et al. 2017). Temporary tortoise fencing would fragment existing habitat for\nterrestrial wildlife species, such as small mammals and reptiles.\nHuman noise and activity associated with construction may also impact wildlife species near the Project.\nIncreased noise levels above baseline conditions would result from construction activities, equipment, and\ntraffic, but would attenuate with distance from the source. Certain wildlife species may acclimate to the\nactivity and return to areas that were formerly avoided. Increased human activity intensifies the potential\nfor wildlife/human interactions, ranging from harassment of general wildlife species to legal harvest or\npoaching. As construction activities would be temporary and intermittent, impacts associated with noise\nand human activity are not anticipated to result in long-term disturbance or avoidance by wildlife.\nImpacts from Project operations would include habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow,\nmodification of adjacent wildlife habitat, direct mortality, increased noise, and increased human activity.\nGround-dwelling wildlife species would be unlikely to use the Project area during operations as the\npermanent tortoise fencing and security fencing would preclude use. Species that may use the Project area\nfor foraging and breeding would also experience long-term impacts resulting from disturbance and loss of\nhabitat; however, large expanses of habitat available adjacent to the Project area are of similar quality and\ncomposition as that which would be lost, and affected individuals would be able to shift use to these\nadjacent areas. As a result, the Project would be unlikely to have a long-term, adverse impact to wildlife\npopulations in the analysis area. Species that may benefit from the Project include scavenger species that\nadapt easily to human-altered landscapes, and small mammals or lizards that may be less vulnerable to\npredation within facility fences (Moore-O\u2019Leary et al. 2017).\nThe fencing mitigation measure (see Section 3.3.8.7) would allow for terrestrial wildlife movement into\nand out of the Project area through installation of 1-foot-wide by 1-foot-long wildlife access holes placed\nat 0.15-mile intervals along the perimeter security fencing, and placement of security fencing 8 inches\naboveground around the panel array block subareas (see Figure 3-6). Application of this measure would\nminimize mortality risk and fragmentation effects to wildlife habitat and populations. Residual effects\n71\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nwould be that the available wildlife habitat may be of lower quality from construction activity impacts\nand the presence of the completed Project.\nThe Project would result in the long-term loss or modification of approximately 383 acres of desert\nbighorn sheep habitat, which represents approximately 3% of the available habitat within the 14,463-acre\nDry Lake Range limited use distribution area (see Figure 3-12) and approximately 0.2% of the Muddy\nHerd\u2019s range in southern Nevada (NDOW 2023). This area of habitat is located at the terminal end of a\nlarger area of occupied limited use habitat. It contains existing disturbance, including access roads and\ntraffic associated with the adjacent, 2,200-acre Apex Landfill. The Project would reduce desert bighorn\nsheep habitat connectivity and availability of movement corridors within the Muddy Herd\u2019s range.\nConsidering the location and existing level of disturbance in and near this habitat, it is unlikely that\ndevelopment of the Project would have a long-term impact to desert bighorn sheep populations.\nThere is no bat roosting habitat located within 1 mile of the Project area, although the area may be used\nby bats as foraging habitat. Night lighting installed for safety purposes may create light pollution in\nspecial-status bat foraging areas, which may disorient foraging bats (Longcore and Rich 2004).\nConstruction would generally occur during daylight hours, would be short term, and would minimize\nlighting at night. A Lighting Plan would be developed to help minimize long-term lighting impacts to bats\nand other wildlife through measures such as the use of sensors, switches, and timers to keep lighting\nturned off when not required and using hooded lights that are directed downward. For these reasons and\nbecause there are large areas of similar foraging habitat adjacent to the Project area, it is unlikely that\nlighting would have a measurable impact to bat populations in the analysis area.\n3.3.12.5.2 MIGRATORY BIRDS\nImpacts to migratory birds from the construction and operations of the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:46\u201348) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and\nDOE 2012:11.3-35\u201311.3-40). The type of impacts from the Project to migratory birds and their habitat are\nconsistent with those described for general wildlife above, and include direct mortality; habitat loss,\nmodification, and fragmentation; increased noise; and increased human activity. Construction of the\nProject would result in the loss of 1,174.9 acres of migratory bird foraging, nesting, and roosting habitat\n(see Table 2-2) (this accounts for 4.8% of the eagle analysis area). Construction activities and increased\nvehicle traffic would result in an increased risk of injury and mortality to individual migratory birds in the\nProject area from collisions. However, birds are highly mobile and are assumed to be able to avoid\nvehicle traffic, clearing, grading, and excavation activities. Increased noise associated with construction\nof the Project would be audible throughout the Project area over the course of the construction phase.\nIncreased noise would result in habitat avoidance and changes to the breeding behavior of migratory birds\nin the Project area. Construction activities would be restricted during nesting season to further reduce the\nrisk of injury or direct mortality of nesting migratory birds (see Appendix E).\nDuring the operations phase, the presence of the Project would contribute to an increased risk of collision\nwith solar panels. There is the potential for solar projects to mimic a \u201clake effect\u201d and act as an attractant\nto water birds and other birds leading to increased risk of collision, injury, and mortality. No direct\nanalyses of the lake effect hypothesis have been published; however, research is underway (Walston et al.\n2018). Migratory birds are also known to collide with lighted structures, including buildings.\nThe gen-tie line would result in an increased risk of electrocution and/or collision to birds flying through\nthe Project area. Because the gen-tie line would be near other existing transmission lines, there would be\nan increase in the risk of electrocution to birds throughout the 30-year duration of the Project. In general,\nthe risks of migratory bird injury or mortality from collisions with solar panels, fencing, buildings, and\nthe gen-tie line would be low. Due to the potential for electrocution, collision, and nesting/perching by\nmigratory birds on overhead power lines, the Applicant would follow Avian Power Line Interaction\nCommittee (APLIC) guidelines (Suggested Practices for Avian Protection on Power Lines [APLIC 2006]\n72\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nand Reducing Avian Collisions with Power Lines [APLIC 2012]) to reduce this risk and comply with the\nMBTA and other federal wildlife laws (see Appendix E).\nProject design features and stipulations (see Appendix E) would minimize potential impacts to protected\nbirds in the Project area. Ground-disturbing activities would be scheduled outside the bird breeding\nseason, which generally occurs from February 15 through August 31 annually. If ground-disturbing\nactivities had to be scheduled during the breeding season, a qualified biologist would survey the area for\nnests immediately prior to commencement of construction activities. If any active nests are found, an\nappropriately sized buffer area, connected to undisturbed habitat, would be established and maintained\nuntil the young birds fledge. Consistent with the Lighting Plan, any lighting on facilities and associated\ninfrastructure would be down-shielded to keep light within the boundaries of the site and within the\nminimum amount and intensity allowable. In addition, sensors, switches, and timers would be used to\nkeep lighting turned off when not required. A Project-specific Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy would\nbe prepared that includes systematic monitoring and an adaptive management plan to assist in avoiding\nand minimizing impacts to migratory birds.\n3.3.12.6 Cumulative Effects\nThe 61,237.2-acre cumulative effects analysis area for wildlife is the Project area plus a 4-mile buffer;\nwithin this area, approximately 20,329 acres (33.2%) have been identified for development. This analysis\narea was chosen to capture impacts to expanses of nearby habitat with similar quality and composition as\nthat of the Project area. Cumulative effects on wildlife from the Project would be similar to those\ndescribed in the Dry Lake East DLA EA (BLM 2019a:48\u201349) and Western Solar Plan PEIS (BLM and\nDOE 2012:11.3-104). The Proposed Action, in conjunction with other projects, would result in\ncumulative impacts to wildlife, including habitat loss and modification. Reasonably foreseeable future\nprojects that have been identified with the potential to affect wildlife in the analysis area include APEX\nIndustrial Park, TransWest Express Transmission Line, Apex Generating Station to Crystal Substation\nTransmission Line, NV Energy Overhead Distribution System, and Greenlink West Transmission Project.\nCumulatively, these projects could result in up to 20,329 acres of disturbance to wildlife habitat.\nDevelopment of the Project would cause an additional 1,174.9 acres of habitat disturbance (see Table\n2-2), which would be an incremental increase of 5.8% to the 20,329-acre total.\nWhen combined with other reasonably foreseeable future actions, and past impacts to the quality and\nquantity of native vegetation in the cumulative impacts analysis area, the Proposed Action would result in\nan incremental increase in reductions in wildlife habitat quality and quantity. In addition, the Project\nwould result in an incremental increase in habitat fragmentation through Project fencing and permanent\nloss of habitat. Project design features and the stipulations listed in Appendix E would help reduce\ncumulative impacts to wildlife from the Project. In addition, reasonably foreseeable future actions would\nbe required to prepare and implement a Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy and comply with suggested\nAPLIC best management practices, which would help reduce overall cumulative impacts to bats and\nmigratory birds.\n3.3.12.7 Mitigation Measures\nThe fencing mitigation measure described in Section 3.3.8.7 could be applied to reduce impacts to\nwildlife.\n73\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\nCHAPTER 4. CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION\n4.1 SCOPING AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION\nThe BLM resource specialists participated in internal scoping discussions to exchange information about\nthe Project and to identify resources and issues to address during the preparation of this EA. Comments\nand input provided by the BLM resource specialists are summarized in Table 3-2 and analyzed in\nSection 3.\nThe BLM notified adjacent ROW grant holders of the Applicant\u2019s pending request for ROW applications\nto construct, operate, maintain, and eventually decommission the proposed Project.\nA 30-day public scoping process was implemented from February 21, 2023, to March 22, 2023. Direct\nmail letters and email notifications were sent to private landowners and other interested parties, as well as\nfederal, state, and local agencies. The BLM collected a total of 18 comment letter submittals during the\nscoping period. Comments were received on topics such as wildlife, special-status species, cultural\nresources, air quality, climate change, soils, hazardous materials, and water resources.\n4.2 COOPERATING AGENCIES\nCooperating agency invitations were sent by certified mail and transmitted electronically on February 21,\n2023. The following entities accepted Cooperating Agency status: NDOW, USFWS, Clark County\nDepartment of Aviation, the EPA, and the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe.\n4.3 TRIBAL GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION\nOn October 11, 2022, the BLM sent an initial notification letter to the following tribes: the Moapa Band\nof Paiutes, Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission\nIndians, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe, Colorado River Indian Tribes, Fort Mojave Indian Tribe, Paiute Indian\nTribe of Utah, Fort Independence Indian Community of Paiute Indians, Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians,\nHualapai Indian Tribe, Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, Utu Utu\nGwaitu Paiute Tribe, Big Pine Paiute Tribe of Owens Valley, Bishop Paiute Tribe, Hopi Tribe, and\nTimbisha Shoshone Tribe. When initiating the scoping period for NEPA, the BLM invited these Tribes to\nparticipate in government-to-government consultation through a letter dated February 21, 2023, with\ninformation about the NEPA review and a follow-up by email.\nThe BLM completed government-to-government consultation meetings with Moapa Band of Paiutes on\nMarch 9, April 13, and May 17, 2023. The BLM completed informal coordination meetings with Twenty-\nNine Palms Band of Mission Indians on March 8, April 12, and December 13, 2023. The Twenty-Nine\nPalms Band of Mission Indians will defer to Moapa Band of Paiutes but would like to continue to receive\nupdates. The Chemehuevi Indian Tribe is participating as a Cooperating Agency. The BLM has not\nreceived any expressions of interest or concern by other Tribes.\nThe Moapa Band of Paiutes shared that the general area is part of a regional cultural landscape and that\nthere is a tribal resource in the area. However, further discussion during the May 17, 2023, meeting noted\nthat the tribal resource may no longer be present. Follow-up email correspondence (November 15, 2023)\nhas occurred about this topic, but further discussion may be needed. In considering any potential visual\nimpacts, the BLM shared the KOPs used in the visual resources analysis for cultural resources by email\non April 13, 2023. The BLM did not receive any feedback regarding the KOPs during the May 17, 2023,\nmeeting or by email. The BLM will continue to consult with Tribes and share the EA for feedback.\n74\nEnvironmental Assessment DOI-BLM-NV-S010-2023-0027-EA\n4.4 NHPA SECTION 106 CONSULTATION WITH NEVADA SHPO\nAND ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION\nThe BLM is required to consider the effects of its actions on historic properties and provide the Advisory\nCouncil on Historic Preservation (ACHP) an opportunity to comment, in compliance with Section 106 of\nthe National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (54 United States Code 306108) and its implementing\nregulations at 36 CFR 800. Consulting parties in this process include the ACHP (should they choose to\nparticipate), the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), Tribes, the Applicant, state and local\ngovernments, other parties, and the public. Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.3, the BLM initiated the NHPA\nSection 106 compliance process for the Proposed Action by inviting the ACHP, SHPO, and Tribes to\nconsult on the undertaking by letter in October 2022.\nThe BLM initiated consultation with the SHPO by a letter dated October 24, 2022. Pursuant to 36 CFR\n800.4(a), this letter included a notification of the proposed Project, the BLM-proposed APE, and\nidentification and evaluation efforts for the undertaking. The SHPO provided feedback on the APE and\nidentification efforts in a response dated November 22, 2022. The BLM considered the initial comments\nfrom the SHPO and any feedback from Tribes in finalizing the APE and identification and evaluation\nefforts. On September 19, 2023, the BLM provided the agency determinations of eligibility for all\nresources identified within the physical APE for SHPO review and concurrence, pursuant to 36 CFR\n800.4(c)(2). The SHPO responded on October 24, 2023, and concurred with BLM determinations of\neligibility for all but one archaeological site. The BLM is continuing to consult with the SHPO on the\ndetermination of eligibility for this resource.\nOn January 11, 2024, the BLM initiated consultation regarding the adverse effect determination with the\nSHPO, Old Spanish Trail Association, and tribes by letter and with the National Park Service \u2013 National\nTrails System by email, as requested, to participate in the development of a memorandum of agreement.\n4.5 ESA SECTION 7 CONSULTATION WITH USFWS\nThe USFWS has jurisdiction over threatened and endangered species listed under the ESA (16 United\nStates Code 1531 et seq.). Formal consultation with the USFWS under Section 7 of the ESA is required\nfor any federal action that may adversely affect a federally listed species. A Project-specific draft\nbiological assessment is being developed. Formal consultation with the USFWS will be initiated\nconcurrently with this EA being made available for public review. Informal consultation with the\nUSFWS, including the Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, has been ongoing and has included coordination\nfor the translocation plan, recipient site for translocation, fencing, connectivity, and health assessments.\n4.6 CONSULTATION WITH OTHERS\nOn February 8, 2023, the BLM held an interdisciplinary team kickoff meeting with BLM resource\nspecialists and cooperating agencies. The following federal, state, and local agencies were contacted for\ninformation, consulted with, or provided an opportunity to consult during preparation of the EA:\n\u2022 Clark County Department of Aviation \u2022 NDOW \u2022 SHPO\n\u2022 NV Energy \u2022 EPA \u2022 USFWS\n4.7 LIST OF PREPARERS AND REVIEWERS\nA list of preparers and reviewers is provided Table 4-1.\n75",
